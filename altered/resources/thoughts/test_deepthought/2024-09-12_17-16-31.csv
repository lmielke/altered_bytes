PowerShell by utilizing the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) and the Get-NvGpu
cmdlet. First, ensure you have the NVIDIA drivers installed and the NVML library
is available. Then, use the following command to get the current GPU usage: Get-
NvGpu | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Utilization. This will display the current
utilization of your NVIDIA GPU."",

    ""answer"": ""The orange color you're referring to is likely the 'warning' or
'caution' state of the NVIDIA GPU utilization indicator. This can occur when the
GPU usage exceeds a certain threshold, typically around 90-95%. The exact
threshold may vary depending on the specific NVIDIA driver and system
configuration."",
