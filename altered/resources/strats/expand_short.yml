    Below is a __Task__ called __"Expand"__ that transforms a "Short Text"
    into an "Expanded Text" by elaborating on key ideas, context, ambiguities,
    environmental factors, assumptions, and potential unknowns. The expansion process includes 
    the following structured sections, which guide the expanded text and enable future analysis:\n
    1. **Conceptual Elaboration**: Define and explain core concepts or terms in the text. This 
       helps establish a foundation for understanding and can serve as a glossary for future reference.\n
    2. **Context and Background**: Explore the broader context or relevance of the topic, which
       can later be expanded to provide historical or situational narratives.\n
    3. **Ambiguity Analysis**: Identify and expand on potential ambiguities in nouns and verbs,
       exploring different interpretations and their implications. This section can later be used 
       to create multiple scenario analyses or alternative perspectives.
    4. **System Environment**: Explore how different systems, setups, or environments affect the topic.
       This includes hardware, interfaces, and supporting systems that could impact the subject's behavior 
       or performance. For abstract cases like the fox, this might seem unusual but is intended to encourage 
       discussion on any relevant environments or external systems that could influence behavior or context.
    5. **Assumption Analysis**: Document and analyze underlying assumptions inferred from the text. These 
       assumptions can be further developed into a manifest or principles guiding the understanding of 
       the content.
    6. **Known Unknowns**: Highlight missing information that limits our full understanding of the statement.
       Specifically, identify gaps in context or detail that prevent a comprehensive analysis. This section 
       can serve as a foundation for developing a question catalogue, aiding in identifying areas for further 
       research or inquiry.

    Consider the example scenario: "The quick brown Fox jumps over the lazy Dog."

    - Example "Short Text":
        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

    - Example "Expanded Text":
        # Conceptual Elaboration
        This sentence describes a quick and agile fox, focusing on its speed and its brown 
        coloration, which reflects natural camouflage...

        # Context and Background
        This sentence is phrased like a factual statement, but most likely is not as such. 
        Instead, it’s a pangram used in typing tests, font demonstrations, 
        and handwriting practice...

        # Ambiguity Analysis
        - **Fox**: There are many types of foxes, such as the red fox and arctic fox. 
          The choice of "brown" suggests a wild fox species native to temperate forests...
        - **Jump**: Jumping can mean a playful leap, a hunting maneuver, or a symbolic act 
          representing overcoming challenges. Each interpretation alters the meaning of the 
          sentence...

        # System Environment
        Foxes operate in various habitats and settings. For example, in snowy regions, 
        a fox’s jump might involve different food acquisition tactics like "mousing," where they leap into snow 
        to catch prey. In forests, food acquisition is more straightforward, but jumping is often used to overcome obstacles like fallen 
        logs. If we think of this in a more abstract sense, one could also consider what external factors (e.g., forest density, weather) or 
        supporting systems (e.g., ecosystem) might influence such behavior...

        # Assumption Analysis
        Given what we know, we can assume that this statement is part of a larger text or 
        exercise designed to test typing speed or font rendering. The sentence is constructed 
        to include all letters of the English alphabet, therefore...

        # Known Unknowns
        The context in which this statement is made is completely missing. We do not know if 
        this is part of a story, an instructional text, or an unrelated exercise. There is also 
        no indication of why this particular scenario was chosen, which leaves gaps in understanding 
        its true purpose. Questions such as "Why a fox?" or "What significance does the dog have?" 
        remain unanswered...

    The provided <{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> must be expanded into a Wiki-style text. 
    Strictly use all 6 example headers:\n 
    - 'Conceptual Elaboration',\n
    - 'Context and Background',\n
    - 'Ambiguity Analysis',\n
    - 'System Environment',\n
    - 'Assumption Analysis',\n
    - 'Known Unknowns'\n
    The expanded text should have approximately {{ instructs.strats.mean_words }} words.

# your_task to be performed
your_task: >
    Expand the text provided inside the <{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> ... </{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> tags
    using ALL 6 example headers and elaboration techniques. 
    The expansion must address ambiguities, explore environmental considerations in detail, 
    and provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n Pay particular attention to the
    'Known Unknowns' section.
