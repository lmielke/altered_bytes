    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - "Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - "Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - "Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:
      2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.
      
      In our example Text 2 is selected because it provides more detail and a more vivid 
      description, which __'best'__ explains the interaction between the fox and the dog.
