    This strategy selects the __'best'__ text or answer from a given <sample> of texts. 
    The selected text should have the strongest supporting details and 
    the most comprehensive coverage of arguments answering the given problem.

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - "Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - "Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - "Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:\n
    ``` JSON
      {
        'best': 2, 
        'reasoning': 'Text 2 provides more detail and a more vivid description.'
      }
    ```
      In our example Text 2 is selected because it provides more detail and a more vivid 
      description, which __'best'__ explains the interaction between the fox and the dog.

# objective to be performed

    Based on the propmt or problem statement as well as the provided texts, 
    the text that __'best'__ addresses the stated or inferred problem must be selected!
    One single aspect from the other texts may be added to the response, 
    if this significantly improves the selected text.

# meta: {"name": "your_task", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}

    Using the prompt and the provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s select and return the single one text, 
    that __'best'__ fits the prompts objective !\n

      {
        'best': <index int>,
