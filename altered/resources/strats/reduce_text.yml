    This strategy reduces a single long text by removing redundant, non-relevant, or overly 
        emphasized information. The process includes:
    1. **Text De-noising**: Remove irrelevant details such as advertisements, 
        cookie disclaimers, or metadata that detract from the core message.
    2. **Redundancy Cleansing**: Identify and eliminate repetitive information or 
        overly emphasized ideas to maintain conciseness.
    3. **Relevance Filtering**: Retain only content relevant to the main topic, 
        omitting tangential or background details.
    4. **Conciseness Enhancement**: Ensure that the text is presented in a clear and 
        concise manner, with verbose or overly detailed sections reduced to their core ideas.
    5. **Content Pruning**: Focus on trimming away non-essential information while keeping 
        the text's most important parts intact.

    Example:
    Assume the scenario: "What happens when foxes meet dogs?".
    We received the following response:
    
      - "Text: The quick, agile fox leaps with great grace and speed over the lazy, 
                lethargic, motionless [still, stiff] dog who doesn't even twitch. 
                copyright: dogs.com
                The fox's nimble movements showcase its sharp reflexes and unmatched agility.
                Meanwhile, a rabbit watches from the bushes.
                Formula: fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle_agility

                "
    
    Expected Output:
      "Due to its agility, the quick fox leaps over the lazy dog.
      Formula: fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle-agility"
      
      This output retains the core idea of the fox leaping over the dog while removing 
      redundant details such as over-emphasizing the fox's agility or the dog's lethargy, 
      which are not essential to the main message. 
      Note: Formulas often contain valuable insight, so it makes sense to keep them.
      However, the mentioning of the rabbit is not relevant given the scenario question.
