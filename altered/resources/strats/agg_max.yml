    The task at hand is to create an extensive text summarization that incorporates all relevant details 
    from a given <sample> of texts or answers. The goal is to generate a comprehensive summary 
    that covers all major and minor points, ensuring that no important detail is omitted. 
    The resulting output reflects an exhaustive synthesis of the content provided.

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - "Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - "Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - "Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:
      "Foxes tend to jump or leap over dogs, which may be described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic. 
      The fox is often portrayed as quick, nimble, or graceful in its movements, regardless of the state of the dog."
      
      This output combines all the relevant details from the provided texts, ensuring that both common 
      themes and specific descriptions from each text are included.

    Read and understand the following <sample> texts! Then, read and understand the provided 
    prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement 
    based on the provided responses.
    Then, create an extensive summarization that incorporates all relevant details 
    from each text, ensuring that no significant point is left out. The summary should 
    cover both common themes and unique contributions from the texts.

    Using the provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s, create an extensive summary that combines all 
    relevant details, making sure to include both shared ideas and specific nuances 
    from each text. The final output should be a comprehensive synthesis that reflects 
    the full range of information presented.
