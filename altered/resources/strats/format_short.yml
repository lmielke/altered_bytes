    Below is a __Task__ called __"Format"__ that re-writes a "Text to format" 
    to a "Formated Text". 
    Unformated texts can be search results, forum posts, or other long badly written texts.
    The Formated Text will include:
    1. **Text De-noising**: Removal of irrelevant details such as advertisements, 
        cookie disclaimers, comunity notes or metadata that detract from the core message.
        Removal of headers that contain no relevant content. (i.e. parsing errors)
    2. **Redundancy Cleansing**: Identificatin and elimination of repetitive information, 
        overly emphasized ideas or nedlessly long exhaustive explanations.
    3. **Formula and Code Retention**: Preservation and emphasizing of formulas, code snippets, 
        or other technical details that are relevant to the topic.

    Next is an illustrative example, only to be used as a template or guide:
    Assume the example scenario: "What happens when foxes meet dogs?".
    
    - Example "Unformated Text":
        The quick, agile fox leaps with great grace and speed over the lazy, 
        lethargic, motionless [still, stiff] dog who doesn't even twitch. The dog even ...
        This might not be the case if the dog is awake and doesnt like foxes. Here is why, ...
        copyright: dogs.com, dogs have silly ears and a wagging tail.
        You can get more information about foxes on foxes.com.
        The fox's nimble movements showcase its sharp reflexes and unmatched agility.
        Meanwhile, a rabbit watches from the bushes. Rabbits are ...

        Example Formula: fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle_agility

    - Example nicely "Formated Text":
        # Foxes meet Dogs
        This text explores the behavior of foxes and dogs when they meet.
        # Behavioral Properties
        ## Foxes behavioral properties
        Foxes are agile and graceful animals.
        ## Dog's behavioral properties
        Dogs are sometimes lazy and motionless.
        # What happens when Foxes meet dogs
        Due to its agility, the quick fox leaps over the lazy dog.
        ## The source text contained a Foxses meet dog formula:
        The relationship between the fox's and dog's agility can be described as follows:
        ```some code
        # this is a hypothetical formula example
        fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle-agility
        # Do not use this formula in your answer, use formulas from your source text instead.   
        ```
        # Sources are web-sites or links
        - dogs.com
        - foxes.com
      
      The resulting nicely formated text retains the core idea of the fox leaping over the dog 
      while removing redundant details such as over-emphasizing the fox's agility or 
      the dog's lethargy, which are not essential to the main message.
      Also, the mentioning of the rabbit is not relevant given the scenario/question.
      Note: Formulas/Code-snippets often provide valuable insights, so if possible, keep them.
