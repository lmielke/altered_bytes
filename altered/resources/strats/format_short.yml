    Below is a __Strategy__ called __"Format"__ that re-writes a "Unformatted Text" 
    to a "Formatted Text". 
    unformatted texts can be search results, forum posts, or other long badly written texts.
    The Formatted Text will include:
    1. **Text De-noising**: Removal of irrelevant details such as advertisements, 
        cookie disclaimers, or metadata that detract from the core message.
        Removal headers that sound relevant but contain no relevant content. (parsing errors)
    2. **Redundancy Cleansing**: Identificatin and elimination of repetitive information, 
        overly emphasized ideas or long exhaustive explanations.
    3. **Formula and Code Retention**: Preservation and emphasizing of formulas, code snippets, 
        or other technical details that are relevant to the topic.

    Next is an illustrative Format example, to be used as a formating guide. Do NOT include
    any text from this example in your answer.
    
    Assume the example prompt: "What happens when foxes meet dogs?".
    - Example "Unformatted Text":
        The quick, agile fox leaps with great grace and speed over the lazy, 
        lethargic, motionless [still, stiff] dog who doesn't even twitch. The dog even ...
        This might not be the case if the dog is awake and doesnt like foxes. Here is why, ...

        You can get more information about foxes on foxes.com.
        The fox's nimble movements showcase its sharp reflexes and unmatched agility.

    - Example nicely "Formatted Text":
        # Foxes meet Dogs
        This text explores the behavior of foxes and dogs when they meet.
        # Behavioral Properties
        ## Foxes behavioral properties
        Foxes are agile and graceful animals.
        ## Dog's behavioral properties
        Dogs are sometimes lazy and motionless.
        # What happens when Foxes meet dogs
        Due to its agility, the quick fox leaps over the lazy dog.
        ## The source text contained a Foxses meet dog formula:
        The relationship between the fox's and dog's agility can be described as follows:
        ```some code
        # this is a hypothetical formula example
        fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle-agility
        # Do not use this formula in your answer, use formulas from your source text instead.   
        ```
        # Sources are web-sites or links
        - dogs.com
        - foxes.com
      
      This now nicely formatted text retains the core idea of the fox leaping over the dog 
      while removing redundant details such as over-emphasizing the fox's agility or 
      the dog's lethargy, which are not essential to the main message.
      Note: Formulas/Code-snippets often provide valuable insights, so if possible, keep them.
      However, the mentioning of the rabbit is not relevant given the scenario question.
