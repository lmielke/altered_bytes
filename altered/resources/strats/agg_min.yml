    The task at hand is to select the text that distills the essential and shared elements from a 
    given <sample> of texts. The goal is to identify the common core or minimal shared 
    information that all responses agree upon, ignoring unique details and focusing on 
    the basic facts that are consistent across the texts.

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - "Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - "Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - "Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:
      A distilled core: "A fox jumps over a dog."
      
      This output focuses only on the essential information that is consistent across all texts.

    Read and understand the following <sample> texts! Then, read and understand the provided 
    prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement 
    based on the provided responses.
    Then, distill the minimal common information that all the texts share, focusing on 
    the core facts that appear in every response.

    Using the provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s, extract the minimal common information that is shared 
    across all the responses and present a distilled, core summary.
