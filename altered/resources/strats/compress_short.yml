    Below is a __Task__ called __"Compress"__ that reduces the length of a "Uncompressed Text"
    to a shorter "Compressed Text" by a specified factor. In cases where strict reduction 
    is required, this task involves prioritizing topics to retain core insights while maintaining
    logical coherence. Compression techniques include:
    1. **Prioritized Content Retention**: Key topics are prioritized based on relevance and contribution
       to the core message, with less critical details omitted.
    2. **Density Optimization**: Text is made information-dense by eliminating redundancy, 
       consolidating, sumarizating headers while ensuring readability and flow.

    Next is an illustrative example, only to be used as a template or guide:
    Assume the example scenario: "Behavioral Adaptations of Foxes in Forest Environments."
    
    - Example "Uncompressed Text":
        # Behavioral Adaptations of Foxes in Woodland Habitats
        Foxes exhibit a variety of adaptive behaviors in forested environments, allowing them to 
        thrive in diverse conditions.
        ## Foraging Behavior
        Foxes are primarily nocturnal foragers, utilizing their keen senses to locate food.
        They adjust their foraging habits based on food availability, season, and predator presence.
        ## Territorial Marking
        Scent marking plays a significant role in foxes' social and territorial behavior. 
        By marking their territory, foxes communicate their presence to other animals 
        and deter potential rivals.
        ## Interaction with Other Species
        Foxes maintain complex relationships with other forest-dwelling species.
        They often compete with other predators for food, and their presence influences 
        local ecosystems.
        ### Example Formula for Food Availability
        A simple formula to represent food availability in relation to fox foraging hours is:
        ```python
        food_availability = forage_hours * area_density
        ```

    - Example nicely "Compressed Text":
        # Fox Behavioral Adaptations in Forrests
        Foxes adapt foraging, marking, and interaction strategies for survival in forests.
        - **Foraging:** Primarily nocturnal, foxes adjust their habits based on food availability 
          and season.
        - **Territorial Marking:** Scent marking helps foxes communicate territory and deter rivals.
        - **Species Interaction:** Foxes influence forest ecosystems and compete with other predators.
        
        Formula for estimating food availability:
        ```python
        food_availability = forage_hours * area_density
        ```

      The compressed text retains the essential behavioral adaptations of foxes while 
      streamlining sub-headers and condensing information for conciseness.

# meta: {"name": "objective", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}
# objective to be performed
objective: >
    The provided <{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> must be reduced in length to about 
    {{ instructs.strats.mean_words }} words following the rules above, prioritizing 
    essential information where needed. The result should be a concise text capturing only
    the most relevant information.

# meta: {"name": "your_task", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}

    Compress the text provided inside the <{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> ... </{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> tags 
    to about {{ instructs.strats.mean_words }} words, retaining prioritized 
    information as per the example.
