    This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <sample> of texts or answers. 
    Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses, 
    with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. Pay more attention to common 
    themes or ideas mentioned by multiple responses, while ensuring that unique details 
    from each response are included where relevant. The result is a balanced summary
    that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring 
    that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - Response 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - Response 2: "A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - Response 3: "The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:
      "Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
      The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
      the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions."
      
      This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
      details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

    Objective is to aggregate multiple responses into one atomic single response 
    using the outlined stratey. The reader should not be bothered with multiple responses,
    their original content and/or any reasoning on how the resulting single response was derived.

    Using the provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s, create a weighted summary using the provided
    stratgey and samples. Do not talk about or reference the original responses. The user
    should only be provided with the final aggreated text.
    NOTE: Generously keep/include formulas and code snippets or shell commands.
