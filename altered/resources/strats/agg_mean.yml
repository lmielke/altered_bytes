description: >
    This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <sample> of texts or answers. 
    Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses, 
    with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary 
    that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring 
    that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - Response 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - Response 2: "A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - Response 3: "The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:
      "Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
      The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
      the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions."
      
      This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
      details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

# task to be performed
task: >
    Read and understand the following <sample> texts! Then, read and understand the provided 
    prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement 
    based on the provided responses.
    Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses, 
    giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions 
    where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

    Using the provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s, create a weighted summary that incorporates 
    key points from all responses. Pay more attention to common themes or ideas mentioned 
    by multiple responses, while ensuring that unique details from each response 
    are included where relevant. 
    NOTE: Generously keep/include formulas and code snippets or shell commands.
