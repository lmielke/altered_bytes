    This strategy reduces a single "Noisy Text" to a single "De-Noised Text"
    by removing redundant, non-relevant, or overly emphasized information.
    The process includes:
    1. **Text De-noising**: Remove irrelevant details such as advertisements, 
        cookie disclaimers, or metadata that detract from the core message.
        Remove headers that sound relevant but contain no relevant content. (parsing errors)
    2. **Redundancy Cleansing**: Identify and eliminate repetitive information, 
        overly emphasized ideas or long exhaustive explanations.
    3. **Relevance Filtering**: Retain only content relevant to the main topic, like formulas,
        code snipptest and core ideas, while omitting tangential or background details.
    4. **Conciseness Enhancement**: Keep it short and to the point.
    5. **Content Pruning**: Focus on trimming away non-essential texts while keeping 
        the most important parts intact.
    6. **Formula and Code Retention**: It is essential to Preserve formulas, code snippets, 
        or other technical details that are relevant to the topic.

    Here is an illustrative example, to be used as a template or guide:
    Assume the example scenario: "What happens when foxes meet dogs?".
    
    - Example "Noisy Text":
        The quick, agile fox leaps with great grace and speed over the lazy, 
        lethargic, motionless [still, stiff] dog who doesn't even twitch. 
        copyright: dogs.com
        The fox's nimble movements showcase its sharp reflexes and unmatched agility.
        Meanwhile, a rabbit watches from the bushes.
        Formula: fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle_agility

    - Example "De-Noised Text":
      "Due to its agility, the quick fox leaps over the lazy dog.
      Formula: fox_agility = dog_agility * 2 - turtle-agility"
      
      This examle output retains the core idea of the fox leaping over the dog while removing 
      redundant details such as over-emphasizing the fox's agility or the dog's lethargy, 
      which are not essential to the main message. 
      Note: Formulas often contain valuable insight, so it makes sense to keep them.
      However, the mentioning of the rabbit is not relevant given the scenario question.

# meta: {"name": "task", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}
# task to be performed
task: >
    The <noisy_text> tag below contains a single "Noisy Text",
    that includes redundant, non-relevant, or overly emphasized information. 
    This text must be cleaned into "De-Noised Text" while following the rules of the
    template/example shown above.

# meta: {"name": "your_task", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}
# your_task to be performed
your_task: >
    Clean the "Noisy Text" provided inside the <noisy_text> ... </noisy_text> tags ! 
    Higlight highly relevant information, but be generous retaining medium relevance information.
    In particular keep and highlight formulas and code snippets relevant to the topic.
