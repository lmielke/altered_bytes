description: >
    This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <sample> 
    of texts or answers. The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, 
    ranging from identical (low variance) to highly divergent (high variance). 
    The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score
    from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification 
    for the score.
    Here is a more detailed explanation of the various std scores:
    0: The texts are virtually identical.
    1: The texts are virtually identical in topic and context, but differ in wording.
    2: The texts handle the same topic, but show minor variations in context and signifficant variations in wording.
    3: The texts handle the same topic, but show signifficant variations in both, context and wording.
    4. The texts show signifficant variations in context and wording. Also at least one text is completely off topic.
    5. The texts are partially related however, there is multiple texts that talk about different topics.
    6. The texts are completely unrelated.

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - "Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - "Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - "Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:
      {
        'std': 2, 
        'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly 
        in wording and emphasis on the dogâ€™s condition.'
      }
      
      In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, 
      leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

    Objective is to derrive a semantic standard deviation between 0 and 6 of the 
    provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s using the outlined stratey. The reader intends to understand 
    the degree of variation or similarity between the provided responses.

# meta: {"name": "your_task", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}
# your_task to be performed
your_task: >
    1. Read and understand provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s! 
    2. Then, read and understand the provided prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), 
    re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses.
    3. Derrive the semantic std along with a brief justification for the score, 
    The output must be in the JSON format: {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification_str>'}.
