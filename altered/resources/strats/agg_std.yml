description: >
    The task at hand is to derrive the standard deviation of similarity between a given <sample> 
    of texts or answers. The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, 
    ranging from identical (low variance) to highly divergent (high variance). 
    The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score
    from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification 
    for the score.\n
    The following std scores apply when: Texts are\n
    0: virtually identical.\n
    1: virtually identical in topic and context, but differ in wording.\n
    2: handling the same topic, with minor variations in context and signifficant variations in wording.\n
    3: handling the same topic, with signifficant variations in both, context and wording.\n
    4. showing signifficant variations in context and wording. Also at least one text is completely off topic.\n
    5. partially related however, there is multiple texts that talk about different topics.\n
    6. completely unrelated.\n

    Example:
    Assume the following prompt or statement, "What happens when foxes meet dogs?". 
    We received the following responses.
      - "Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      - "Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed."
      - "Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog."
    Expected Output:\n
    ``` JSON
      {
        'std': 2, 
        'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ signifficantly in wording and emphasis on the dog condition.'
      }
    ```
      In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, 
      leading to a relatively small variance score of 2.

    Objective is to derrive a semantic standard deviation between 0 and 6 of the 
    provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s using the outlined stratey. The reader intends to understand 
    the degree of variation or similarity between the provided responses.

# meta: {"name": "your_task", "type": "string", "default": "", "example": ""}

your_task: >
    1. Read and understand provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s! 
    2. Then, read and understand the provided prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), 
    re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses.
    3. Derrive the semantic std along with a brief justification for the score, 
    The output must be in JSON format:\n
    ``` JSON
      {
        'std': <int>, 
        'reasoning': '<justification_str>'
      }
    ```
