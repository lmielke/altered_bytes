    This task generates a structured series of questions designed to clarify and elaborate 
    on a given topic or problem. The aim is to uncover missing information and provide a 
    deeper understanding of the subject, enabling the user to identify actionable steps or 
    insights. The questions are designed to adapt to a wide variety of contexts, ensuring 
    applicability to both general inquiries and specific technical challenges.

    Consider the first example scenario: "Why is the sky blue?"
    
    - Example "Source Text":
        # Conceptual Elaboration
        The question "Why is the sky blue?" touches on atmospheric physics, light scattering, 
        and the perception of color. To fully address this question, it is essential to 
        explore the scientific principles behind light behavior and human vision.
        
        # Example Generated Questions:
        1:
            Question: What factors influence the color of the sky during the day?
            Answers:
                - The scattering of sunlight by atmospheric particles.
                - The angle of the sun in the sky.
                - The composition of the atmosphere.
            Reasoning: Understanding these factors provides the basis for explaining why 
            the sky appears blue and not some other color during the day.
            
        2:
            Question: Does the sky appear blue under all conditions?
            Answers:
                - Yes, under normal atmospheric conditions.
                - No, it changes color during sunrise and sunset.
                - No, it varies under extreme weather or pollution.
            Reasoning: This question explores variations in sky color, linking it to specific 
            phenomena like sunsets or environmental factors.
            
    
    Consider another example scenario: "How do I manage high CPU usage on my Windows machine?"
    
    - Example "Source Text":
        # Conceptual Elaboration
        The question "How do I manage high CPU usage on my Windows machine?" focuses on 
        identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks. It requires knowledge of system 
        monitoring tools, common causes of high CPU usage, and best practices for optimizing 
        performance.
        
        # Example Generated Questions:
        1:
            Question: What tool do you use to monitor CPU usage?
            Answers:
                - Task Manager.
                - Resource Monitor.
                - Third-party tools like Process Explorer.
            Reasoning: Understanding the preferred tool provides insight into the level of 
            detail available to the user and the potential next steps for troubleshooting.
            
        2:
            Question: What is the primary cause of high CPU usage on your system?
            Answers:
                - A specific application or process.
                - Malware or unwanted software.
                - Background updates or system tasks.
            Reasoning: Identifying the root cause helps narrow down the focus to either 
            addressing software issues or optimizing processes.
            
        3:
            Question: How often does your system experience high CPU usage?
            Answers:
                - Only during specific tasks like gaming or rendering.
                - Frequently, even during idle states.
                - Occasionally, under normal usage conditions.
            Reasoning: Knowing the frequency of the issue helps determine whether the cause 
            is tied to specific workloads or system misconfigurations.

    The provided <{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> must be read and fully understood. 
    Therefore, a series of targeted questions must be generated to clarify the topic and 
    uncover any missing information. These questions should be relevant to the user's 
    inquiry and adaptable to both broad conceptual issues and specific technical challenges. 
    Each question must include 3 - 7 answer options and a 'Reasoning' block explaining why 
    the question is asked and how the answer helps address the main topic.

    Generate a set of questions based on missing information to clarify and elaborate on the 
    text provided inside the <{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> ... </{{ instructs.strats.inputs_tag }}> tags. 
    The questions should aim to make the topic comprehensible and actionable, regardless of 
    whether it is a general inquiry or a specific technical challenge. For each question, 
    include 3 - 5 answer options and a 'Reasoning' block explaining its relevance.
