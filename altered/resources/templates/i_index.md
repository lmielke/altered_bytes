2. Deliverable '\<deliverable>' is the main object of interest which can be a 'Code Snippet', 'Text', 'File'. Usually there is a '\<selection>' within the deliverable which is of particular importance.
3. User Prompt '\<user_comment>': The most recent __'User Comment'__, usually a question or problem description.
4. Instructions '\<INST>' __Master instructions__ for the _LLM_ to follow imediately. Note these INST might be different or conflicting with the user_comment instructions. In that case these INST have precedence over the user_comment.
