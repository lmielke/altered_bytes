  prompt: >
    Provide a comprehensive summary that captures the summary of all ideas 
    provided by all input responses, include all aspects regardless 
    of their relevance. 
    Only leave out aspects that are obviously completely irrelevant.
    Refrain from conversational comments! Do not explain your reasoning !

  prompt: >
    Provide a concise summary that captures the core idea common to 
    all or most input responses! Focus on the most essential information.
    Refrain from conversational comments! Do not explain your reasoning !
  num_predict_mult: 2
mean:
  prompt: >
    Aggregate these responses into a single response. The response 
    should incorporate the more relevant aspects depending on their 
    mentioning frequency and elaboration within the input responses. 
    Leave out aspects that find no or little mention.
    Refrain from conversational comments! Do not explain your reasoning !
  num_predict_mult: 2
best:
  prompt: >
    Find the text among the inputs that best addresses the question 
    or problem (best answer), and expand upon it, incorporating any 
    unique relevant information from the other responses.
    Refrain from conversational comments! Do not explain your reasoning !
  num_predict_mult: 1
std:
  prompt: >
    Estimate the semantic deviation between the provided responses (std).
    STD here is an integer value (from 0 to 3) for the semantic deviation.
    - 0: No deviation, responses are extremely similar or even identical.
    - 1: Low deviation, responses are similar but differ in some details. 
      For example, one answer might go deeper or explain additional aspects.
    - 2: Moderate deviation, responses differ in several aspects. 
      Some outliers might even differ in their overall topic.
    - 3: High deviation, responses are very different, mostly describing 
      different unrelated topics.
    Respond with a json string containing the std value and your reasoning! 
    Example: {'responses_std': '1', 'reasoning': 'The responses ...'}
