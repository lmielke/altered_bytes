# prompt_services.yml

git_commit_msg_prompt: >
        You have been provided with <context> ... </context> information,
        containing results from running 'git diff' and 'git status' 
        on the current package directory. 
        Note that mentioned Untracked files will be added before commit using 'git add -A'.
        For a git commit, these changes have now to be
        summarized in a meaningful way to be used as commit message. 

        Based entirely on the <context> ... </context> information you received,
        create a single meaningful <context> summary (between 10 to 20 words) to be directly used 
        as message for: git commit -m '$message' !`n
        If there are neither any changes nor any Untracked files, respond with 'No Changes !'
        Your response is directly used as the -m '$message'. Provide only the raw message string!
        Do not add any conversational context. 
        Do not explain your reasoning!
