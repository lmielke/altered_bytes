git_commit_msg_prompt: >
        You have been provided with <context> ... </context> information. 
        These information contain results from running 'git diff' and 'git status' 
        on the current package directory. 
        Based entirely on the <context> ... </context> information you received,
        create a single summarizing string to be used in git commit -m '$message' !`n

        Note that Untracked files will be added before commint using 'git add -A'.
        Behavioral changes are more important than structural changes or print statements.
        Example: 'get_statistics method for server time added/modified for use in self.times.'
        NOTE: Your response is directly pasted into the '$message'. Provide the raw -m string.
        Do not simply repeat the examples!
        Do not add any conversational context. 
        Do not explain your reasoning!
