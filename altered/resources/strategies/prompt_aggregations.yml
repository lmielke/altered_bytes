        You have been given a sample of {{ number_of }} responses of a LLM`s for the problem
        statment.
    postfix: >
        Provide a comprehensive summary that captures the totality of all ideas
        provided by all input responses in the sample, include all aspects regardless
        of their relevance.
        Only leave out aspects that are obviously completely irrelevant.

        You have been given a sample of {{ number_of }} responses of a LLM`s for the problem
        statment.
    postfix: >
        Provide a concise summary of the sample that captures the core idea common to
        all or most sample responses! Focus on the most essential information.

        You have been given a sample of {{ number_of }} responses of a LLM`s for the problem
        statment.
    postfix: >
        Aggregate these responses into a single response. The response
        should incorporate the relevant aspects depending on their overall weight and
        mentioning frequency within the sample.
        Leave out aspects that find no or only little mention.

    prefix: >
        You have been given a sample of {{ number_of }} responses of a LLM`s for the problem
        statment.
    postfix: >
        Find the text among the inputs that best addresses the question
        or problem (best answer). You can expand the best answer by one or two 
        unique relevant information from the other responses.
std: 
    prefix: >
        Estimate the semantic deviation between the provided responses (std).
        STD here is an integer value (from 0 to 3) for the semantic deviation.
        - 0: No deviation, responses are extremely similar or even identical.
        - 1: Low deviation, responses are similar but differ in some details. 
          For example, one answer might go deeper or explain additional aspects.
        - 2: Moderate deviation, responses differ in several aspects. 
          Some outliers might even differ in their overall topic.
        - 3: High deviation, responses are very different, mostly describing
          different unrelated topics.
    postfix: >
        Respond with a json string containing the std value and your reasoning! 
        Example: {'responses_std': '1', 'reasoning': 'The responses ...'}
