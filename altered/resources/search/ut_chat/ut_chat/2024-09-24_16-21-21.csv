# LLM Prompt
This is a LLM (Large Language Model) prompt, asking the LLM to answer a given quesiton, or to solve a problem. 
The LLM prompt consists of 3 blocks.
1. Context Information '<[34mcontext[39m>': Relevant available information for you to better understand the problem.
2. User Prompt '<[33muser_prompt[39m>': The recent user Question or Instruction.
3. Instructions '<[36mINST[39m>': __Master instructions__ for the _LLM_ to follow right now.

## To Do
You were provided with a <[33muser_prompt[39m> or question in the text above.  Use all available sources of information from <[34mcontext[39m> and <[33muser_prompt[39m> to  prepare a high quality response.

## Std Aggregation
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Read the provided prompts or  re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.
