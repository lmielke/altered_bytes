# LLM Prompt
This is a LLM (Large Language Model) prompt, asking the LLM to answer a given quesiton, or to solve a problem. 
The LLM prompt consists of 3 blocks.
1. Context Information '<[34mcontext[39m>': Relevant available information for you to better understand the problem.
2. User Prompt '<[33muser_prompt[39m>': The recent user Question or Instruction.
3. Instructions '<[36mINST[39m>': __Master instructions__ for the _LLM_ to follow right now.

"{'std': 1, 'reasoning': 'The responses are highly similar in providing step-by-step instructions on how to monitor GPU performance using built-in monitoring tools. The only difference is in the specific steps and software mentioned, but the overall content and structure of the responses are identical.'}","Used strategy_template: agg_std

## Std Aggregation
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <sample> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <sample> texts! Read the provided prompts or  re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.

Response 1: To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Use built-in monitoring tools**:
	* Windows: Press the Windows key + X and select Task Manager. Go to the ""Performance"" tab to see a graphical representation of CPU, Memory, Disk, and GPU usage.
	* macOS (via Boot Camp or virtualization): Use the built-in Activity Monitor or install third-party software like GPU Monitor.
	* Linux

Response 2: To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and techniques. Here are some steps to help you do so:

1. **Use built-in monitoring tools**: Most GPUs have built-in monitoring tools that provide information on temperature, clock speed, memory usage, and fan speed. You can access these tools through the NVIDIA Control Panel (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD Radeon Settings (for AMD GPUs).
2. **Utilize third-party software**: There are several third-party software options available to monitor
