# LLM Prompt
This is a LLM (Large Language Model) prompt, asking the LLM to answer a given quesiton, or to solve a problem. 
The LLM prompt consists of 3 blocks.
1. Context Information '<[34mcontext[39m>': Relevant available information for you to better understand the problem.
2. User Prompt '<[33muser_prompt[39m>': The recent user Question or Instruction.
3. Instructions '<[36mINST[39m>': __Master instructions__ for the _LLM_ to follow right now.

"To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps to help you:

1. **Use built-in monitoring tools**: Most GPUs have built-in monitoring tools that can be accessed through the motherboard or GPU settings in your computer BIOS.
2. **Check GPU usage**: Use the Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) to see how much of your CPU and GPU resources are being used by individual programs.

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Read the provided prompts or  re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
