# LLM Prompt
This is a LLM (Large Language Model) prompt, asking the LLM to answer a given quesiton, or to solve a problem. 
The LLM prompt consists of 3 blocks.
1. Context Information '<[34mcontext[39m>': Relevant available information for you to better understand the problem.
2. User Prompt '<[33muser_prompt[39m>': The recent user Question or Instruction.
3. Instructions '<[36mINST[39m>': __Master instructions__ for the _LLM_ to follow right now.

## To Do
You were provided with a <[33muser_prompt[39m> or question in the text above.  Use all available sources of information from <[34mcontext[39m> and <[33muser_prompt[39m> to  prepare a high quality response.

# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Std Aggregation
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <sample> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <sample> texts! Read the provided prompts or  re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.

Response 1: To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Use built-in monitoring tools**: Most GPUs have built-in monitoring tools that allow you to track their performance in real-time. For example, NVIDIA's GeForce Experience and AMD's Radeon Software provide detailed information about your GPU's usage, temperature, and memory usage.
2. **Use third-party software**: There are many third-party software tools available that can monitor your GPU's performance

Response 2: To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps to help you do so:

1. **Check your GPU usage**: You can check how much of your GPU is being used by running a task manager or system monitor on your computer. This will give you an idea of how heavily your GPU is being utilized.
2. **Use GPU monitoring software**: There are several software tools available that can help you monitor your GPU's performance, such as:

Response 3: To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Use built-in monitoring tools**: Most modern GPUs have built-in monitoring tools that can be accessed through the device manager or a control panel on Windows or System Information on macOS.
2. **Use software-specific monitoring tools**: If you're using a specific software that utilizes your GPU, such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Blender, they often have their own built-in performance monitoring tools.

</sample>

## Your Task
From the provided responses, calculate a standard deviation score between 0 and 6 to  reflect the degree of similarity or variance. Include a brief justification for the score,  explaining how much the responses have in common or differ. The output should be in the  format: {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification_str>'}.
