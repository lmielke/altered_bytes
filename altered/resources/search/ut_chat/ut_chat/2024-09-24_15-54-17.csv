"To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here's a balanced summary of the key points from all responses:

You can start by using built-in monitoring tools, such as Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on macOS, to check your GPU usage and temperature. Additionally, you can install software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to monitor GPU performance and temperatures.

Most GPUs have a built-in monitoring system that allows you to track their performance.","Strategy Template:
