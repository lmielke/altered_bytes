List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an 
existing list.
Example:
Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits 
with the letter ""a"" in the name.
Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement 
with a conditional test inside:
With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:
The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.
The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to 
True.
Only accept items that are not ""apple"":
The condition
if x != ""apple"" 
 will return True for all elements other 
than ""apple"", making the new list contain all fruits except ""apple"".
The condition is optional and can be omitted:
With no if statement:
The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.
You can use the range() function to create an iterable:
Same example, but with a condition:
Accept only numbers lower than 5:
The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the 
outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new 
list:
Set the values in the new list to upper case:
You can set the outcome to whatever you like:
Set all values in the new list to 'hello':
The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a 
way to manipulate the outcome:
Return ""orange"" instead of ""banana"":
The expression in the example above says:
""Return the item if it is not banana, if it is banana return orange"".
Consider the following code:fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']newlist = [x for x in fruits if x == 'banana']What will be the value of newlist?

This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail,
and adds some new things as well.
The list data type has some more methods.  Here are all of the methods of list
objects:
Add an item to the end of the list.  Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].
Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.  Equivalent to
a[len(a):] = iterable.
Insert an item at a given position.  The first argument is the index of the
element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of
the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).
Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x.  It raises a
ValueError if there is no such item.
Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it.  If no index
is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.
It raises an IndexError if the list is empty or the index is
outside the list range.
Remove all items from the list.  Equivalent to del a[:].
Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x.
Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.
The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice
notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of
the list.  The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full
sequence rather than the start argument.
Return the number of times x appears in the list.
Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort
customization, see sorted() for their explanation).
Reverse the elements of the list in place.
Return a shallow copy of the list.  Equivalent to a[:].
An example that uses most of the list methods:
You might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort that
only modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default
None. [1]  This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in
Python.
Another thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or
compared.  For instance, [None, 'hello', 10] doesn’t sort because
integers can’t be compared to strings and None can’t be compared to
other types.  Also, there are some types that don’t have a defined
ordering relation.  For example, 3+4j < 5+7j isn’t a valid
comparison.
The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last
element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”).  To add an
item to the top of the stack, use append().  To retrieve an item from the
top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index.  For example:
It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is
the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not
efficient for this purpose.  While appends and pops from the end of list are
fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all
of the other elements have to be shifted by one).
To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to
have fast appends and pops from both ends.  For example:
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of
some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to
create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.
For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:
Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists
after the loop completes.  We can calculate the list of squares without any
side effects using:
or, equivalently:
which is more concise and readable.
A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed
by a for clause, then zero or more for or if
clauses.  The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression
in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.
For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not
equal:
and it’s equivalent to:
Note how the order of the for and if statements is the
same in both these snippets.
If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the (x, y) in the previous example),
it must be parenthesized.
List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:
The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression,
including another list comprehension.
Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of
3 lists of length 4:
The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:
As we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in
the context of the for that follows it, so this example is
equivalent to:
which, in turn, is the same as:
In the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex flow statements.
The zip() function would do a great job for this use case:
See Unpacking Argument Lists for details on the asterisk in this line.
There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its
value: the del statement.  This differs from the pop() method
which returns a value.  The del statement can also be used to remove
slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment
of an empty list to the slice).  For example:
del can also be used to delete entire variables:
Referencing the name a hereafter is an error (at least until another value
is assigned to it).  We’ll find other uses for del later.
We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and
slicing operations.  They are two examples of sequence data types (see
Sequence Types — list, tuple, range).  Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data
types may be added.  There is also another standard sequence data type: the
tuple.
A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:
As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested
tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding
parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is
part of a larger expression).  It is not possible to assign to the individual
items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable
objects, such as lists.
Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different
situations and for different purposes.
Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of
elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing
(or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples).
Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are
accessed by iterating over the list.
A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the
syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these.  Empty tuples are constructed
by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by
following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value
in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.  For example:
The statement t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' is an example of tuple packing:
the values 12345, 54321 and 'hello!' are packed together in a tuple.
The reverse operation is also possible:
This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any
sequence on the right-hand side.  Sequence unpacking requires that there are as
many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the
sequence.  Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple
packing and sequence unpacking.
Python also includes a data type for sets.  A set is an unordered collection
with no duplicate elements.  Basic uses include membership testing and
eliminating duplicate entries.  Set objects also support mathematical operations
like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.  Note: to
create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an
empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.
Here is a brief demonstration:
Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions
are also supported:
Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see
Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as
“associative memories” or “associative arrays”.  Unlike sequences, which are
indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be
any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.  Tuples can be used
as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains
any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.
You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index
assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and
extend().
It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs,
with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of
braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of
key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the
dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.
The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and
extracting the value given the key.  It is also possible to delete a key:value
pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old
value associated with that key is forgotten.  It is an error to extract a value
using a non-existent key.
Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys
used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use
sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the
dictionary, use the in keyword.
Here is a small example using a dictionary:
The dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of
key-value pairs:
In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from
arbitrary key and value expressions:
When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using
keyword arguments:
When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be
retrieved at the same time using the items() method.
When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can
be retrieved at the same time using the enumerate() function.
To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired
with the zip() function.
To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward
direction and then call the reversed() function.
To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the sorted() function which
returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.
Using set() on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. The use of
sorted() in combination with set() over a sequence is an idiomatic
way to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order.
It is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it;
however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.
The conditions used in while and if statements can contain any
operators, not just comparisons.
The comparison operators in and not in are membership tests that
determine whether a value is in (or not in) a container.  The operators is
and is not compare whether two objects are really the same object.  All
comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all
numerical operators.
Comparisons can be chained.  For example, a < b == c tests whether a is
less than b and moreover b equals c.
Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and and or, and
the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated
with not.  These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between
them, not has the highest priority and or the lowest, so that A and
not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C. As always, parentheses
can be used to express the desired composition.
The Boolean operators and and or are so-called short-circuit
operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation
stops as soon as the outcome is determined.  For example, if A and C are
true but B is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression
C.  When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a
short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.
It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression
to a variable.  For example,
Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done
explicitly with the
walrus operator :=.
This avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing =
in an expression when == was intended.
Sequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence
type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two
items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the
comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until
either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves
sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out
recursively.  If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are
considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the
shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.  Lexicographical ordering for
strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters.
Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type:
Note that comparing objects of different types with < or > is legal
provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods.  For example,
mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals
0.0, etc.  Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the
interpreter will raise a TypeError exception.
Footnotes
Other languages may return the mutated object, which allows method
chaining, such as d->insert(""a"")->remove(""b"")->sort();.

Beispiel:

 

 
 












Ausgabe
Syntax: newList =  [ Ausdruck(Element) für Element in oldList , wenn Bedingung ] 
Parameter:
Rückgabe: Der Rückgabewert einer Listenableitung ist eine neue Liste mit den geänderten Elementen, die die angegebenen Kriterien erfüllen.
Die Python-Listenableitung bietet eine viel kürzere Syntax zum Erstellen einer neuen Liste basierend auf den Werten einer vorhandenen Liste.
Hier ist ein Beispiel für die Verwendung der Listenableitung, um das Quadrat einer Zahl in Python zu ermitteln.

 

 
 












Ausgabe
In diesem Beispiel weisen wir der Liste 1, 2 und 3 zu und drucken die Liste mithilfe der Listenableitung.

 

 
 












Ausgabe
In diesem Beispiel drucken wir die geraden Zahlen von 0 bis 10 mithilfe der Listenableitung.

 

 
 












Ausgabe
In diesem Beispiel weisen wir den Zeilen 3 der Matrix die Ganzzahlen 0 bis 2 zu und drucken sie mithilfe der Listenableitung aus.

 

 
 












Ausgabe
Es gibt verschiedene Möglichkeiten, eine Liste zu durchlaufen. Der gängigste Ansatz ist jedoch die Verwendung einer for- Schleife . Schauen wir uns das folgende Beispiel an:

 

 
 












Ausgabe
Oben sehen Sie die Implementierung des herkömmlichen Ansatzes zum Durchlaufen einer Liste, Zeichenfolge, eines Tupels usw. Die Listenableitung in Python erledigt nun dieselbe Aufgabe und vereinfacht das Programm zudem. 
List Comprehensions translate the traditional iteration approach using for loop into a simple formula hence making them easy to use. Below is the approach to iterate through a list, string, tuple, etc. using list comprehension in Python.

 

 
 












Output
The list comprehensions in Python are more efficient both computationally and in terms of coding space and time than a for a loop. Typically, they are written in a single line of code. The below program depicts the difference between loops and list comprehension based on performance.

 

 
 












Output
From the above program, we can see list comprehensions are quite faster than for loop.
Nested List Comprehensions are nothing but a list comprehension within another list comprehension which is quite similar to nested for loops. Below is the program which implements nested loop:

 

 
 












Output
Now by using nested list comprehensions, the same output can be generated in fewer lines of code.

 

 
 












Output
Lambda Expressions are nothing but shorthand representations of Python functions. Using list comprehensions with lambda creates an efficient combination. Let us look at the below examples:
In this example, we are inserting numbers from 10 to 50 in the list and printing it.

 

 
 












Output
Here, we have used for loop to print a table of 10.

 

 
 












Output
 Now here, we have used only list comprehension to display a table of 10.

 

 
 












Output
Finally, we use lambda + list comprehension to display the table of 10. This combination is very useful to get efficient solutions in fewer lines of code for complex problems.
We can also add conditional statements to the list comprehension. We can create a list using range(), operators, etc. and cal also apply some conditions to the list using the if statement.
Key Points
Below are some examples which depict the use of list comprehensions rather than the traditional approach to iterate through iterable:
In the example,  we are checking that from 0 to 7 if the number is even then insert Even Number to the list else insert Odd Number to the list.

 

 
 












Output
In this example, we are inserting numbers in the list which is a multiple of 10 to 100, and printing it.

 

 
 












Output
In this example, we are inserting a square from 1 to 10 to list and printing the list.

 

 
 












Output
In this example, we are making a transpose of the matrix using list comprehension.

 

 
 












Output
In this example, we toggle the case of each character in a given string using the XOR operator with 32 and store the result in a list.

 

 
 












Output
In this example, we are reversing strings in for loop and inserting them into the list, and printing the list.

 

 
 












Output
In this example, we have created two lists of names and ages. We are using zip()  in list comprehension and we are inserting the name and age as a tuple to list. Finally, we are printing the list of tuples.

 

 
 












Output:
In this example, We have created a list and we are finding the digit sum of every odd element in the list.

 

 
 












Output
Below are two exercise questions on Python list comprehension. We have covered basic list comprehension code to find the cube of numbers and code to find the length of a word using list comprehension and the len() function.
Q1. Cube of numbers exercise question using list comprehension

 

 
 












Output
Q2. Finding word length exercise question using list comprehension
