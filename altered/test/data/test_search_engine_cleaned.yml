    The first
    argument is the index of the\nelement before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at
    the front of\nthe list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).\nRemove the
    first item from the list whose value is equal to x.  It raises a\nValueError if there is no
    such item.\nRemove the item at the given position in the list, and return it.  If no
    index\nis specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.\nIt raises an
    IndexError if the list is empty or the index is\noutside the list range.\nRemove all items
    from the list.  Equivalent to del a[:].\nReturn zero-based index in the list of the first
    item whose value is equal to x.\nRaises a ValueError if there is no such item.\nThe
    optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice\nnotation and are used to
    limit the search to a particular subsequence of\nthe list.  The returned index is computed
    relative to the beginning of the full\nsequence rather than the start argument.\nReturn the
    number of times x appears in the list.\nSort the items of the list in place (the arguments
    can be used for sort\ncustomization, see sorted() for their explanation).\nReverse the
    elements of the list in place.\nReturn a shallow copy of the list.  Equivalent to a[:].\nAn
    example that uses most of the list methods:\nYou might have noticed that methods like
    insert, remove or sort that\nonly modify the list have no return value printed – they
    return the default\nNone. [1]  This is a design principle for all mutable data structures
    in\nPython.\nAnother thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted
    or\ncompared.  For instance, [None, \'hello\', 10] doesn’t sort because\nintegers can’t be
    compared to strings and None can’t be compared to\nother types.  Also, there are some types
