"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we'll analyze the key points and common themes from each response.

**Common Themes:**

1. **NVIDIA-smi**: All three responses mention NVIDIA-smi as a command-line tool for monitoring GPU performance.
2. **GPU-Z**: Two responses (SAMPLES 1 and 3) mention GPU-Z as a tool for providing detailed information about the GPU.
3. **HWiNFO**: One response (SAMPLE 2) mentions HWiNFO as a comprehensive system monitoring tool that includes GPU monitoring capabilities.

**Unique Details:**

1. **Nsight Systems**: RESPONSE SAMPLE 2 mentions Nsight Systems as a tool specifically for NVIDIA GPUs.
2. **MSI Afterburner**: RESPONSE SAMPLE 3 mentions MSI Afterburner as a software for monitoring and overclocking GPUs.
3. **Linux top command with GPU-specific flags**: RESPONSE SAMPLE 1 mentions using the Linux top command with specific flags to monitor GPU performance.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we'll assign weights based on the frequency of each theme or unique detail mentioned across all responses.

* NVIDIA-smi: 3/3 (all responses mention it)
* GPU-Z: 2/3 (SAMPLES 1 and 3 mention it)
* HWiNFO: 1/3 (SAMPLE 2 mentions it)
* Nsight Systems: 1/3 (SAMPLE 2 mentions it)
* MSI Afterburner: 1/3 (SAMPLE 3 mentions it)
* Linux top command with GPU-specific flags: 1/3 (SAMPLE 1 mentions it)

**Summary:**

To monitor your GPU performance, you can use the following tools and methods:

1. **NVIDIA-smi**: This is a command-line tool provided by NVIDIA that displays detailed information about your GPUs, including temperature, memory usage, and performance metrics.
2. **GPU-Z**: This is a free tool that provides detailed information about your GPU, including model name, memory size, and driver version.
3. **HWiNFO**: This is a comprehensive system monitoring tool that includes GPU monitoring capabilities.
4. **Nsight Systems**: This is a tool specifically for NVIDIA GPUs that provides detailed performance metrics.
5. **MSI Afterburner**: This is a popular software for monitoring and overclocking your GPUs.
6. **Linux top command with GPU-specific flags**: You can use","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
