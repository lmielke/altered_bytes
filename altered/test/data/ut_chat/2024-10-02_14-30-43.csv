"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, I will analyze the key points and common themes mentioned in each response.

**Common Themes:**

1. GPU monitoring tools: Nsight, Radeon Pro Advisor, NVIDIA's built-in monitoring tools, `nvidia-smi`, `GPU-Z`, TensorFlow's TensorBoard, PyTorch's Profiler.
2. Importance of regular maintenance: cleaning up and maintaining drivers and firmware, monitoring system temperature to prevent overheating.
3. Adjusting workload and batch sizes for optimal GPU utilization.

**Unique Details:**

1. Response 1 mentions using popular options like Nsight and Radeon Pro Advisor.
2. Response 2 provides additional information on using command-line tools like `nvidia-smi` and leveraging deep learning frameworks' built-in monitoring tools.
3. Response 3 discusses employing system monitoring tools like `htop`, `glances`, or `sysdig` to track overall system resource utilization, including GPU performance.

**Weighted Summary:**

>`# Answer
GPU monitoring is crucial for optimizing performance. You can use tools like Nsight, Radeon Pro Advisor, and NVIDIA's built-in monitoring tools to track your GPU's temperature, memory usage, and clock speed.

To monitor GPU performance in real-time, you can also use command-line tools like `nvidia-smi` (for Linux) or `NVidia Monitor` (for Windows). Additionally, many deep learning frameworks provide built-in monitoring tools, such as TensorFlow's TensorBoard or PyTorch's Profiler.

Regularly cleaning up and maintaining your GPUs drivers and firmware is essential. Monitoring system temperature to prevent overheating is also vital. Adjusting your workload and batch sizes can help optimize GPU utilization.

For more accurate and comprehensive monitoring, consider using specialized software like `GPU Monitor`, `RivaTuner`, or `MSI Afterburner`. These tools provide detailed insights into GPU temperatures, voltage, and clock speeds, allowing for better optimization and cooling configurations.

# Additional Tips
- Use a combination of command-line tools and GUI-based monitoring software to get a comprehensive view of your GPU performance.
- Regularly check your system's temperature to prevent overheating.
- Experiment with different workload and batch sizes to find the optimal configuration for your specific use case.`","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_mean:

[34m## Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
