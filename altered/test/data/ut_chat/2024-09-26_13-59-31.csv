"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. One common approach is to use the built-in monitoring software provided by your GPU manufacturer, such as NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software, which allow you to track GPU usage, temperature, and memory usage in real-time.

You can also use third-party applications like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to monitor your GPU's performance and other system components. Additionally, many Linux distributions come with built-in monitoring tools like `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs and `amdgpu-pro` for AMD GPUs.

It is also recommended to check your system's Event Viewer (Windows) or System Logs (Linux/Mac) for any errors or warnings related to your GPU. By using these tools and methods, you can get a detailed understanding of your GPU's performance and identify any potential issues.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
