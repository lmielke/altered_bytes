"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps:

*   Use the built-in monitoring tool in your graphics driver control panel to check for updates and adjust settings.
*   Utilize software like GPU-Z or HWiNFO to get detailed information about your GPU's specifications and temperatures.
*   Check for any system crashes or freezes that may indicate a performance issue with your GPU.

Additionally, consider using built-in monitoring tools provided by your GPU manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce Experience, AMD Radeon Software) or system monitoring tools like Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (Mac), or System Monitor (Linux). Also, check for driver updates to ensure you have the latest performance optimizations. If the problem persists, try updating your graphics drivers or adjusting power settings.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Read the provided prompts or  re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 3__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. First, ensure that your system is running the latest drivers for your graphics card. Then, consider using software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to monitor temperatures, clock speeds, and memory usage. You can also check your system's Event Viewer (Windows) or System Logs (Linux/macOS) for any hardware-related errors. Additionally, many modern GPUs have built-in monitoring tools, such as NVIDIA's GeForce Experience or AMD's Radeon Software. These tools provide detailed performance metrics and often allow you to adjust settings for optimal performance.
