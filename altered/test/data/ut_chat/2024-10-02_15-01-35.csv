"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, I will analyze the key points mentioned in each response and assign weights based on their frequency and relevance.

**Common Themes:**

1. Monitoring GPU performance using software (Nsight, Radeon Software)
2. Using command-line utilities (nvidia-smi, radeon_profiler)
3. Checking temperatures to ensure safe operation
4. Regularly updating drivers for optimal performance

**Unique Details:**

1. Nsight Systems provides detailed information on system resources, including GPU utilization.
2. GPU-Z displays detailed information about graphics cards, including temperature and memory usage.
3. HWiNFO provides detailed information about system hardware, including GPU performance and temperatures.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, I will assign weights to each common theme based on their frequency in the responses:

* Monitoring GPU performance using software (Nsight, Radeon Software): 4/5
* Using command-line utilities (nvidia-smi, radeon_profiler): 3.5/5
* Checking temperatures to ensure safe operation: 4.5/5
* Regularly updating drivers for optimal performance: 4/5

**Common Themes with Weighted Details:**

1. Monitoring GPU performance using software:
	* Nsight Systems provides detailed information on system resources, including GPU utilization (4/5)
	* GPU-Z displays detailed information about graphics cards, including temperature and memory usage (3.5/5)
2. Using command-line utilities:
	* nvidia-smi for NVIDIA GPUs (3.5/5)
	* radeon_profiler for AMD GPUs (3.5/5)

**Unique Details with Weighted Summary:**

1. Checking temperatures to ensure safe operation:
	* Monitor temperatures to prevent overheating (4.5/5)
2. Regularly updating drivers for optimal performance:
	* Check for driver updates from the manufacturer (4/5)

**Final Weighted Summary:**

Monitoring GPU performance using software is a crucial step in maintaining optimal system performance. Nsight Systems and GPU-Z provide detailed information on system resources, including GPU utilization and graphics card specifications. Regularly checking temperatures to ensure safe operation is also essential. Additionally, updating drivers regularly can improve performance.

To get started, install one or more of the mentioned tools (Nsight, Radeon Software, nvidia-smi, radeon_profiler) and use their respective commands or interfaces to","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_mean:

[34m## Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
