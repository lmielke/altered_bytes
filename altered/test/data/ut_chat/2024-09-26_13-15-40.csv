"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools like NVIDIA Control Panel (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD Radeon Settings (for AMD GPUs). System monitoring software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 provide detailed information about your GPU's specifications and performance. Additionally, some games and applications have built-in performance monitoring features. On Linux, use `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs and `amdgpu-pro-smi` for AMD GPUs. Many graphics cards come with their own monitoring software, such as MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X1. These tools help track GPU temperature, usage, memory usage, and more, allowing you to identify potential issues and optimize your system's performance.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Firstly, check the manufacturer's software for monitoring and control, such as NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software. These tools provide real-time performance data, including temperature, fan speed, and usage.

You can also use system monitoring software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to get detailed information about your GPU's specifications and performance. Additionally, some games and applications may have built-in performance monitoring features.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools like NVIDIA Control Panel (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD Radeon Settings (for AMD GPUs). You can also use third-party software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to get detailed information about your GPU's specifications and performance. Additionally, you can check your system's event logs for any errors or warnings related to the GPU. If you're experiencing issues with your GPU's performance, restarting your computer or updating your drivers may help resolve the problem.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 3__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools such as NVIDIA Control Panel (for Windows) or AMD Radeon Settings (for Windows and macOS). On Linux, you can use system monitors like `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs and `amdgpu-pro-smi` for AMD GPUs. Additionally, many graphics cards come with their own monitoring software, such as MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X1. These tools allow you to track GPU temperature, usage, memory usage, and more, helping you identify potential issues and optimize your system's performance.
