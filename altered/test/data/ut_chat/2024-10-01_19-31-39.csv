"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we'll analyze the key points and themes mentioned in each response.

**Common Themes:**

1. **GPU Monitoring Tools:** All three responses mention various tools for monitoring GPU performance, including NVIDIA-smi, GPU-Z, HWiNFO, and system monitoring software.
2. **Real-time Data:** Multiple responses emphasize the importance of real-time data on GPU usage, temperature, memory usage, and other performance metrics.

**Unique Details:**

1. **NVIDIA-smi:** Response 1 specifically mentions NVIDIA-smi as a command-line tool for detailed information about NVIDIA GPUs.
2. **GPU-Z:** Response 2 highlights GPU-Z as a free tool that displays detailed information about graphics cards.
3. **HWMonitor:** Response 3 introduces HWMonitor as a software that monitors system temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we'll give more emphasis to common themes while incorporating unique details from each response.

""To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and software. The most commonly recommended tools include:

* NVIDIA-smi (a command-line tool for detailed information about NVIDIA GPUs)
* GPU-Z (a free tool that displays detailed information about graphics cards)
* HWiNFO (a comprehensive system monitoring tool that includes GPU monitoring capabilities)

Additionally, you can use real-time data from tools like `nvidia-smi` and `GPU-Z` to identify any issues with your GPU and optimize its performance.

For more information on monitoring GPU performance, refer to the official documentation of NVIDIA or AMD, depending on your GPU manufacturer.""

This summary incorporates key points from all responses while giving more weight to common themes (GPU monitoring tools and real-time data) and unique details (NVIDIA-smi, GPU-Z, and HWMonitor).","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
