{

Note: The responses all provide the same information about monitoring GPU performance using various tools, with minor variations in phrasing and formatting.","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_std:

[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m>  of texts or answers. The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts,  ranging from identical (low variance) to highly divergent (high variance).  The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  for the score. Here is a more detailed explanation of the various std scores:
 0: The texts are virtually identical.
 1: The texts are virtually identical in topic and context, but differ in wording.
 2: The texts handle the same topic, but show minor variations in context and signifficant variations in wording.
 3: The texts handle the same topic, but show signifficant variations in both, context and wording.
 4. The texts show signifficant variations in context and wording. Also at least one text is completely off topic.
 5. The texts are partially related however, there is multiple texts that talk about different topics.
 6. The texts are completely unrelated.


[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
 ```JSON
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ signifficantly in wording and emphasis on the dog condition.'
  }
```
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, 
  leading to a relatively small variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Objective is to derrive a semantic standard deviation between 0 and 6 of the  provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s using the outlined stratey. The reader intends to understand  the degree of variation or similarity between the provided responses.

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use tools such as:
* NVIDIA GeForce Experience (for NVIDIA GPUs)
* AMD Radeon Software (for AMD GPUs)
* GPU-Z (a third-party tool that supports both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs)
* Linux command-line tools like `nvidia-smi` or `aticonfig`
These tools provide information on temperature, memory usage, clock speed, and other performance metrics.
