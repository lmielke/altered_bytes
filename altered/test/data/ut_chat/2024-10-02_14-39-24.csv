"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we'll analyze the key points from each answer and synthesize them into a balanced summary.

**Common Themes:**

1. **GPU monitoring tools:** All three responses mention popular GPU monitoring tools such as NVIDIA Nsight Systems, GPU-Z, MSI Afterburner, NVML, and AMD's GPU Monitor.
2. **Real-time data tracking:** Responses 1 and 2 emphasize the importance of real-time data tracking for optimal performance and prevention of overheating.

**Unique Details:**

1. **Command-line interface (CLI) usage:** Response 3 highlights the use of the CLI of your GPU driver to monitor its performance.
2. **Additional tools:** Response 2 mentions additional tools like dxdiag, nvidia-smi, and HWiNFO for more detailed information.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we'll assign weights based on the frequency of each theme or idea mentioned across all responses:

* Common themes (GPU monitoring tools, real-time data tracking): 60%
* Unique details (CLI usage, additional tools): 30%
* Additional context (prevention of overheating, optimal performance): 10%

**Summary:**

To monitor your GPU's performance, use a combination of tools and software. Some popular options include:

* NVIDIA Nsight Systems
* GPU-Z
* MSI Afterburner
* NVML
* AMD's GPU Monitor

These tools provide real-time data on temperature, memory usage, and clock speeds. Additionally, you can utilize the command-line interface (CLI) of your GPU driver to monitor its performance.

For optimal performance and prevention of overheating, use tools like dxdiag or nvidia-smi on Linux systems, or HWiNFO on Windows systems. These tools offer more detailed information on your GPU's performance metrics.

By using these tools and software, you can ensure your GPU is running at optimal levels and prevent potential issues with overheating.","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_mean:

[34m## Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
