2. Various tools and methods can be used to monitor GPU performance, including NVIDIA Driver Monitoring Tool, GPU-Z, System Monitor, Benchmarking Tools, and Command Line Interface (CLI) commands like `nvidia-smi`.
3. Tracking key metrics such as temperature, power consumption, and memory usage is essential for identifying potential issues.

**Unique Details:**

1. Response 2 mentions using NVML and CUDA Profiler for monitoring GPU performance.
2. Response 3 provides additional information on software available for monitoring GPU performance, including GPU-Z and HWiNFO.

**Weighted Summary:**

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use a combination of tools and methods:

### 1. NVIDIA Driver Monitoring Tool
Download and install the NVIDIA driver monitoring tool to track your GPU's temperature, memory usage, and other performance metrics.

### 2. GPU-Z
Use GPU-Z to view detailed information about your GPU, including its model, memory, and clock speeds.

### 3. System Monitor
Open the system monitor to view real-time data on your GPU's performance, including temperature, fan speed, and memory usage.

### 4. Benchmarking Tools
Run benchmarking tools like Unigine Heaven or Valley to test your GPU's performance under different conditions.

### 5. Command Line Interface (CLI)
Use command line interface commands like `nvidia-smi` to monitor your GPU's performance and receive notifications when it reaches a certain temperature threshold.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use NVML for monitoring GPU performance, especially if you're using an NVIDIA GPU.
* Utilize the CUDA Profiler for profiling and analyzing the performance of your GPU-based applications.
* Keep an eye on key metrics such as temperature, power consumption, and memory usage to identify potential issues.
* Consider using software like GPU-Z or HWiNFO to monitor your GPU's temperature, voltage, and fan speed.

By following these steps and using a combination of tools and methods, you can effectively monitor your GPU's performance and ensure optimal system performance.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
