"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we need to identify common themes, unique details, and assign weights to each response based on their relevance.

**Common Themes:**

1. Monitoring GPU performance
2. Using tools like NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's Radeon Software
3. Tracking system temperature, voltage, and memory usage

**Unique Details:**

1. Response 1 mentions using HWiNFO for monitoring GPU temperatures and voltages.
2. Response 2 provides additional resources for more information on GPU manufacturer documentation.
3. Response 3 suggests using `nvidia-smi` for monitoring NVIDIA GPUs.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we'll assign weights to each response based on their relevance to the common themes and unique details.

* Common Theme 1 (Monitoring GPU performance): 30% weight
	+ Response 1: ""You can monitor your GPUs performance using various tools and software.""
	+ Response 2: ""To monitor GPU performance, you can use tools such as NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's Radeon Software.""
	+ Response 3: ""To monitor GPU performance, you can use tools like NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's GPU Monitor.""
* Common Theme 2 (Using tools): 20% weight
	+ Response 1: ""You can monitor your GPUs performance using various tools and software.""
	+ Response 2: ""To monitor GPU performance, you can use tools such as NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's Radeon Software.""
	+ Response 3: ""To monitor GPU performance, you can use tools like NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's GPU Monitor.""
* Unique Detail 1 (HWiNFO): 15% weight
	+ Response 1: ""You can install the recommended tools according to your operating system's instructions. You can also use HWiNFO for monitoring GPU temperatures and voltages.""
* Unique Detail 2 (GPU manufacturer documentation): 10% weight
	+ Response 2: ""For more information, refer to the official documentation for your specific GPU manufacturer.""
* Unique Detail 3 (`nvidia-smi`): 5% weight
	+ Response 3: ""You can also track your system's temperature, voltage, and memory usage using software like HWiNFO or GPU-Z. Additionally, many Linux distributions come with built-in tools like `nvidia-smi` for monitoring NVIDIA GPUs","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
