"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we need to identify common themes and unique details from each response.

**Common Themes:**

1. Monitoring GPU performance is essential for optimal performance, preventing overheating, and reducing energy costs.
2. Various tools and software can be used to monitor GPU performance, such as NVIDIA Nsight Systems, AMD Radeon Pro Center, HWiNFO, and MSI Afterburner.
3. Regular monitoring can help identify common issues like high temperatures, low frame rates, and power consumption exceeding expected levels.

**Unique Details:**

1. Response Sample 2 provides specific tools for monitoring GPU performance, such as NVIDIA GeForce Experience and AMD Radeon Software.
2. Response Sample 3 highlights the importance of using multiple tools to get a comprehensive view of GPU performance.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we will assign a score to each common theme based on its frequency of mention across all responses. We will then use these scores to determine the weight of each theme in the final summary.

| Theme | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Monitoring GPU performance is essential | 9/10 |
| Various tools and software can be used | 8/10 |
| Regular monitoring helps identify common issues | 7/10 |

**Summary:**

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and software. Some popular options include NVIDIA Nsight Systems, AMD Radeon Pro Center, HWiNFO, and MSI Afterburner.

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure optimal performance, prevent overheating, and reduce energy costs. You can use tools like NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software to monitor your GPU's performance in real-time.

Additionally, it's recommended to use multiple tools to get a comprehensive view of GPU performance. By doing so, you can identify common issues like high temperatures, low frame rates, and power consumption exceeding expected levels.

**Code Snippet:**

You can use the following command to monitor your GPU's performance using nvidia-smi:
```
nvidia-smi
```
This will provide detailed information on temperature, memory usage, clock speeds, and other metrics.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
