"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods.

One common approach is to utilize built-in monitoring software provided by your GPU manufacturer, such as NVIDIA's GeForce Experience or AMD's Radeon Software. These tools offer real-time performance metrics, including temperature, clock speed, memory usage, and power consumption.

Additionally, third-party software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 can provide detailed information about your GPU's specifications, temperatures, and performance metrics in real-time.

You can also check the system resource usage in your computer's Task Manager or System Monitor to see how much of a load your GPU is handling. This can be particularly useful for identifying potential issues or optimizing your system's performance.

By using these tools and methods, you can effectively monitor your GPU's performance and make informed decisions about its maintenance and optimization.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods:

*   **GPU Monitoring Software:** Utilize software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to track your GPU's temperature, clock speed, memory usage, and other relevant metrics.
*   **System Monitor Tools:** Use system monitoring tools like Windows Task Manager (Windows) or System Monitor (Linux/Mac) to view GPU-related data such as usage percentage and temperature.
*   **Built-in Features:** Check if your GPU manufacturer provides built-in monitoring features in their software or drivers, which can offer detailed performance information.
