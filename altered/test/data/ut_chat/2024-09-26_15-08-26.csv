"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. One common approach is to utilize software provided by your GPU manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software), which offer real-time performance metrics such as temperature, clock speed, memory usage, and power consumption.

You can also use third-party applications like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to monitor your GPU's performance. These tools provide detailed information about your graphics card's specifications, temperatures, and usage metrics.

Additionally, many games and applications offer built-in performance monitoring features, and some operating systems (e.g., Windows 10) provide built-in tools for monitoring system resource usage, including GPU performance. You can also try using third-party tools like Afterburner or EVGA Precision X1 for more detailed control over your GPU settings.

Note: The summary is a weighted average of the three responses, with more emphasis on common themes and ideas mentioned by multiple responses. Unique details from each response are included where relevant.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. First, check the manufacturer's software for monitoring and control utilities, such as NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software. These programs provide detailed information about GPU usage, temperatures, and fan speeds.

You can also use system monitoring tools like CPU-Z, GPU-Z, or HWiNFO to get a comprehensive overview of your system's hardware components, including the GPU.

Additionally, many games and applications offer built-in performance monitoring features. You can also try using third-party tools like Afterburner or EVGA Precision X1 for more detailed control over your GPU settings.
