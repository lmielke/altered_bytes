"# Weighted Summary of GPU Performance Monitoring Tools
## Overview

To monitor GPU performance, various tools and software can be used. The following summary provides an overview of the most commonly used tools.

### 1. NVIDIA GeForce Experience

NVIDIA's GeForce Experience is a popular tool that allows users to monitor their GPU usage, temperature, and fan speed. It also provides features like automatic driver updates and customizable lighting.

### 2. GPU-Z

GPU-Z is a free tool that displays detailed information about the graphics card, including its model, memory, and clock speeds. This can be useful for identifying any issues with the GPU.

### 3. HWiNFO

HWiNFO is another free tool that provides detailed information about the system's hardware, including the GPU. It also includes features like monitoring CPU usage and temperature.

### 4. System Monitoring Software (e.g., Task Manager, Activity Monitor)

Most operating systems come with built-in system monitoring software that allows users to monitor their GPU usage, along with other system resources like CPU and memory.

### 5. Command Line Tools (e.g., `nvidia-smi`, `glxgears`)

For Linux users, the `nvidia-smi` command can be used to monitor GPU performance and temperature. On Windows, the `glxgears` command can be used to test GPU performance.

### 6. Overclocking Software (e.g., MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision X)

If users want to overclock their GPU, they'll need software like MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X, which allow them to monitor and adjust the GPU's clock speeds and voltage settings.

## Formula for Weighted Summary

Weighted Sum = (Frequency of Tool A \* Value of Tool A) + (Frequency of Tool B \* Value of Tool B) + ...

Where:
- Frequency is the number of times a tool is mentioned in the responses.
- Value is the importance or relevance of each tool.

## Code Snippet for Weighted Summary

[34m## Description: Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. Pay more attention to common  themes or ideas mentioned by multiple responses, while ensuring that unique details  from each response are included where relevant. The result is a balanced summary that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Objective is to aggregate multiple responses into one atomic single response  using the outlined stratey. The reader should not be bothered with multiple responses, their original content and/or any reasoning on how the resulting single response was derived.
