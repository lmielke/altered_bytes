"```json
{
  ""std"": 1,
  ""reasoning"": ""The texts are virtually identical in topic and context, but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on specific tools.""
}
```

Note: The std score of 1 indicates that the responses share a common theme and provide similar information, but with minor variations in wording and emphasis.","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_std:

[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m>  of texts or answers. The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts,  ranging from identical (low variance) to highly divergent (high variance).  The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  for the score. Here is a more detailed explanation of the various std scores:
 0: The texts are virtually identical.
 1: The texts are virtually identical in topic and context, but differ in wording.
 2: The texts handle the same topic, but show minor variations in context and signifficant variations in wording.
 3: The texts handle the same topic, but show signifficant variations in both, context and wording.
 4. The texts show signifficant variations in context and wording. Also at least one text is completely off topic.
 5. The texts are partially related however, there is multiple texts that talk about different topics.
 6. The texts are completely unrelated.


[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
 ```JSON
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ signifficantly in wording and emphasis on the dog condition.'
  }
```
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, 
  leading to a relatively small variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Objective is to derrive a semantic standard deviation between 0 and 6 of the  provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s using the outlined stratey. The reader intends to understand  the degree of variation or similarity between the provided responses.

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are a few:

* **GPU-Z**: A free tool that provides detailed information about your GPU, including its model, memory, and performance metrics.
* **MSI Afterburner**: A popular overclocking and monitoring tool that allows you to adjust fan speeds, voltage, and other settings to optimize your GPU's performance.
* **NVIDIA GeForce Experience** (for NVIDIA GPUs): A software suite that includes a performance monitor, allowing you to track frame rates, temperatures, and other metrics in real-time.
* **AMD Radeon Settings** (for AMD GPUs): A control panel that provides access to performance monitoring tools, including GPU usage, temperature, and fan speed controls.
* **Linux command-line tools**: For Linux users, commands like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `radeontop` (for AMD GPUs) can provide detailed information about your GPU's performance and status.

These are just a few examples of the many tools available to monitor your GPU's performance.
