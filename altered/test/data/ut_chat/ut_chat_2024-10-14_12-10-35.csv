[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Description: Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. Pay more attention to common  themes or ideas mentioned by multiple responses, while ensuring that unique details  from each response are included where relevant. The result is a balanced summary that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Objective is to aggregate multiple responses into one atomic single response  using the outlined stratey. The reader should not be bothered with multiple responses, their original content and/or any reasoning on how the resulting single response was derived.
