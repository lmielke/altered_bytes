"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we need to identify common themes and unique details from each response.

**Common Themes:**

* Monitoring GPU performance is crucial for optimal system performance.
* Various tools can be used to monitor GPU performance, including command-line utilities like `nvidia-smi` and GPU-specific software like GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software.
* Regularly checking and adjusting fan speeds, voltage, and cooling settings can help maintain optimal GPU performance.

**Unique Details:**

* Response 1 mentions using NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's PowerTune for detailed information on temperature, power consumption, and memory usage.
* Response 2 provides a list of tools that can be used to monitor GPU performance, including `nvidia-smi`, GPU-Z, and system monitoring software like CPU-Z or HWiNFO.
* Response 3 emphasizes the importance of tracking performance metrics such as frame rates, memory utilization, and power consumption.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we can assign weights to each common theme based on its frequency of mention across all responses. We can then use these weights to calculate a weighted average score for each unique detail.

Let's assume the following weights:

* Common Theme 1 (Monitoring GPU performance): 0.6
* Common Theme 2 (Using various tools): 0.4

We can then calculate the weighted average score for each unique detail as follows:

* Response 1: Weighted Average = (0.6 x ""Use NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's PowerTune"") + (0.4 x ""Regularly check and adjust fan speeds, voltage, and cooling settings"")
* Response 2: Weighted Average = (0.6 x ""Use command-line utilities like `nvidia-smi`"") + (0.4 x ""Track performance metrics such as frame rates, memory utilization, and power consumption"")
* Response 3: Weighted Average = (0.6 x ""Regularly check and adjust fan speeds, voltage, and cooling settings"") + (0.4 x ""Use GPU-specific software like GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software"")

Using these weights, we can calculate the weighted average score for each unique detail:

* Response 1: Weighted Average = 0.6 x ""Use NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's PowerTune"" + 0.4 x ""Regularly check and adjust fan speeds, voltage, and","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
