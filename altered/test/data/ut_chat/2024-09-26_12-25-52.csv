"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps to get you started:

*   Use built-in monitoring software provided by your GPU manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software) or system monitoring tools like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to get detailed information about your GPU.
*   Keep an eye on your system's resource usage in the Task Manager (Windows) or System Monitor (macOS) to see how your GPU is performing under different workloads.
*   Utilize third-party software such as Afterburner to monitor temperature, clock speed, and memory usage. Many games and applications have built-in performance monitoring features, which can be searched for in your device's app store.

This summary gives more emphasis to common themes like using built-in monitoring software or system monitoring tools, while incorporating unique details from each response where relevant.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
