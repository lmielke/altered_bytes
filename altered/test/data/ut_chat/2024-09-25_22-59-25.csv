"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools and software provided by the manufacturer, such as NVIDIA's GeForce Experience or AMD's Radeon Software. These utilities allow tracking of temperature, clock speed, memory usage, and more.

Third-party software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner (for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs respectively) also offer advanced monitoring features. Additionally, you can check system event logs for any GPU-related issues.

It's worth noting that some operating systems have built-in GPU monitoring tools, and referring to the user manual or manufacturer's support team can provide specific instructions if needed.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools and software. First, check the manufacturer's website for specific monitoring software. Many GPUs come with pre-installed utilities that provide detailed performance metrics. Additionally, you can use third-party applications like GPU-Z or HWiNFO to monitor temperature, clock speeds, and memory usage. Some operating systems also have built-in GPU monitoring tools. You can also check the system's event logs for any issues related to the GPU. If you're unsure about specific instructions, refer to your GPU's user manual or contact the manufacturer's support team.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# Answer
You can monitor your GPU's performance by using built-in tools and software. Here are some ways to do it:

*   **NVIDIA System Monitor**: If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can use the System Monitor tool that comes with your graphics drivers.
*   **GPU-Z**: A lightweight utility that provides detailed information about your GPU, including temperature, memory usage, and more.
*   **Afterburner** or **EVGA Precision X**: Software specifically designed for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs respectively, offering advanced monitoring and control features.
