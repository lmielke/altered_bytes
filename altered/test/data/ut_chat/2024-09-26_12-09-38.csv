"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. One common approach is to use software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD Radeon Software (for AMD GPUs). These programs provide detailed information about your GPU's specifications, temperature, clock speed, and usage.

You can also check your system's Event Viewer (Windows) or System Logs (Linux/Mac) for any errors or warnings related to your GPU. Additionally, some graphics cards have built-in monitoring tools that display performance metrics on the screen.

It's essential to note that the specific methods and tools may vary depending on your operating system and GPU model. Using built-in monitoring software provided by your GPU manufacturer, such as NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software, can also be a good approach. These programs offer real-time performance metrics, including temperature, clock speed, and memory usage.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. One common approach is to use the built-in monitoring software provided by your GPU manufacturer, such as NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software. These programs offer real-time performance metrics, including temperature, clock speed, and memory usage.

You can also use third-party tools like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to monitor your GPU's performance. Additionally, many Linux distributions provide built-in monitoring tools, such as `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs.

It's essential to note that the specific methods and tools may vary depending on your operating system and GPU model.
