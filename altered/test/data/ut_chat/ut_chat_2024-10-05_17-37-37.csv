[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.

[34m# Answer[39m
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use the following tools and methods:

[34m## 1. NVIDIA Driver Version[39m
Check the NVIDIA driver version installed on your system. Outdated drivers may cause performance issues. Update to the latest version.

[34m## 2. GPU Monitoring Software[39m
Use software like MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision X, or AMD Radeon Software to monitor temperature, voltage, and memory usage.

[34m## 3. System Resource Monitoring Tools[39m
Utilize tools like `nvidia-smi` (for Linux) or `nvcc` (for Windows) to display GPU information, such as memory usage, temperature, and clock speeds.

[34m## 4. Benchmarking Software[39m
Run benchmarking tests using applications like Unigine Heaven, Valley, or 3DMark to evaluate your system's performance under specific workloads.

[34m## 5. System Logs[39m
Monitor system logs for any error messages related to the GPU, which can indicate performance issues or hardware problems.

Remember to restart your system after making changes to the driver version or software settings to ensure they take effect.
