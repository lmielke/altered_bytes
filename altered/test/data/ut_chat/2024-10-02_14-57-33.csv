"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we need to identify common themes and unique details from each response.

**Common Themes:**

* All three responses mention NVIDIA-smi, GPU-Z, HWiNFO, and MSI Afterburner as tools for monitoring GPU performance.
* They also mention system monitoring software like CPU-Z and AIDA64.
* The importance of tracking temperature, memory usage, clock speeds, and power consumption is emphasized.

**Unique Details:**

* RESPONSE SAMPLE 2 mentions NVIDIA Nsight and AMD Radeon Software as additional tools for monitoring GPU performance.
* RESPONSE SAMPLE 3 provides a more detailed overview of the available tools and software, including overclocking capabilities.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, we can assign weights to each common theme based on its frequency of mention across all responses. We can then use these weights to determine the importance of each unique detail.

Here is a possible weighted summary:

""GPU monitoring tools like NVIDIA-smi, GPU-Z, HWiNFO, and MSI Afterburner are essential for tracking key metrics such as temperature, memory usage, clock speeds, and power consumption. Additionally, system monitoring software like CPU-Z and AIDA64 can provide valuable insights into your system's hardware. For those looking to take their monitoring to the next level, NVIDIA Nsight and AMD Radeon Software offer advanced features like overclocking capabilities.

**Example Code Snippet:**
```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used --format=csv,nounits
```
This command uses NVIDIA-smi to display the used memory of each GPU in the system, providing a quick snapshot of current usage. Similarly, you can use:
```bash
hwinfo --gpu
```
To view detailed information about your graphics card, including temperature, voltage, and more.

**Note:** The weights assigned to each common theme are subjective and may vary depending on individual preferences. This summary is intended to provide a general overview of the available tools and software for monitoring GPU performance.""","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_mean:


[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
