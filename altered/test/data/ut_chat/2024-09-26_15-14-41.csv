"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Most GPUs come with built-in monitoring software that provides real-time information about temperature, usage, and memory. You can also utilize system monitoring tools like Task Manager (Windows), System Monitor (Linux), or Activity Monitor (Mac) to get detailed information about GPU performance.

Additionally, dedicated GPU monitoring tools like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD GPU Monitor (for AMD GPUs) provide detailed information about GPU temperature, clock speeds, memory usage, and more. It's also a good idea to check your system's event logs for any GPU-related errors or warnings.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively monitor your GPU's performance.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. First, check the manufacturer's software for any built-in monitoring capabilities. Many GPUs come with their own utilities that provide detailed information about usage, temperature, and memory usage.

You can also use third-party programs like GPU-Z or HWMonitor to get a comprehensive view of your GPU's performance. These tools can be downloaded from the internet and are widely available for most operating systems.

Additionally, some games and applications may have their own built-in monitoring features that allow you to track your GPU's performance while running those specific titles.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some steps:

*   **Use built-in monitoring software**: Most GPUs come with built-in monitoring software that provides real-time information about temperature, usage, and memory.
*   **Utilize system monitoring tools**: Tools like Task Manager (Windows), System Monitor (Linux), or Activity Monitor (Mac) can provide detailed information about GPU performance.
*   **Check for dedicated monitoring software**: Some GPUs require specific software to monitor their performance. Check your GPU manufacturer's website for recommended tools.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively monitor your GPU's performance.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 3__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. First, ensure your system is configured to show GPU usage in the task manager or system monitoring software. You can also use dedicated GPU monitoring tools like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD GPU Monitor (for AMD GPUs). These tools provide detailed information about GPU temperature, clock speeds, memory usage, and more. Additionally, you can check your system's event logs for any GPU-related errors or warnings.
