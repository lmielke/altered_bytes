# Answer
Monitoring GPU performance can be done using various tools and software. Here are some common methods:

### 1. NVIDIA SMI (System Management Interface)

NVIDIA provides an open-source tool called NVIDIA SMI, which allows you to monitor and manage your GPUs. You can use the `nvidia-smi` command in the terminal to view detailed information about your GPU usage, temperature, memory, and performance.

### 2. GPU-Z

GPU-Z is a free tool that displays detailed information about your graphics card, including its model, memory, and temperature. You can download GPU-Z from the official website and run it as an executable file.

### 3. HWiNFO

HWiNFO is another popular tool that provides detailed information about your hardware, including your GPUs. It also has a built-in monitor for real-time system and GPU monitoring.

### 4. Resource Monitor

Windows Resource Monitor is a built-in utility that allows you to monitor system resources, including GPU usage. You can access it by pressing the Windows key + R, typing ""resmon"", and pressing Enter.

### 5. CUDA Profiler

If you want to overclock your GPU, use software like MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X to monitor and adjust your GPU's clock speed.

### 6. Graphical Monitoring Tools

Tools like GPUwatch, GPU Monitor, or Afterburner allow you to visually monitor your GPU usage in real-time, often providing detailed information about temperature, memory, and performance.

Remember to always follow proper safety precautions when working with high-performance GPUs, as they can generate significant heat and noise.

[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.
