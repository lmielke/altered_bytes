"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, I will analyze the key points mentioned in each response and assign weights based on their frequency and relevance.

**Common Themes:**

1. **GPU monitoring tools**: All three responses mention specific tools for monitoring GPU performance, such as `nvidia-smi`, `GPUtil`, `HWiNFO`, and System Monitor.
2. **Real-time monitoring**: Two responses (SAMPLES 1 and 3) emphasize the importance of real-time monitoring to identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.

**Unique Details:**

1. **GPU-Z**: SAMPLE 3 provides a specific tool, GPU-Z, which is not mentioned in the other two responses.
2. **Nsight Systems**: SAMPLE 3 also mentions Nsight Systems, a visual debugger for NVIDIA GPUs, which is not explicitly mentioned in SAMPLES 1 and 2.

**Weighted Summary:**

To create a weighted summary, I will assign weights to each common theme based on their frequency:

* GPU monitoring tools (4/5): All three responses mention specific tools, with `nvidia-smi` being the most widely mentioned.
* Real-time monitoring (3/5): Two responses emphasize real-time monitoring, while one response does not.

To incorporate unique details, I will add a note for each:

* GPU-Z: SAMPLE 3 provides a useful tool for detailed GPU information.
* Nsight Systems: SAMPLE 3 mentions a visual debugger for NVIDIA GPUs, which is worth noting.

**Weighted Summary:**

To monitor your GPU performance, you can use tools such as `nvidia-smi` or `GPUtil`. These tools provide detailed information on GPU usage, temperature, and memory consumption. Additionally, real-time monitoring is crucial to identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance. For a more in-depth analysis, consider using GPU-Z, which provides detailed information about your GPU, including its model, memory, and driver version. Nsight Systems, a visual debugger for NVIDIA GPUs, can also be used to monitor system performance in real-time.

Note: The weights assigned are subjective and based on my analysis of the responses.","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_mean:


[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__[2m[37mRESPONSE SAMPLE[0m[0m 1__
[34m# Answer[39m
To monitor your GPU performance, you can use tools such as NVIDIA's Nsight Systems or AMD's Radeon Profiler. These tools provide detailed information on GPU usage, temperature, and memory consumption.

You can also use command-line utilities like `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs or `radeon_profiler` for AMD GPUs to monitor performance metrics.

Additionally, many operating systems have built-in monitoring tools that allow you to track system resources, including GPU usage. For example, on Windows, you can use the Task Manager to view GPU usage, while on Linux, you can use the `top` or `htop` command to monitor system resources.

__[2m[37mRESPONSE SAMPLE[0m[0m 2__
>`# Answer
GPU monitoring tools can be used to track performance. Some popular options include:
Nvidia-smi (for NVIDIA GPUs)
GPUtil (for multi-GPU systems)
HWiNFO (for hardware monitoring)
System Monitor (built-in macOS tool)`

[34m# Answer[39m
To monitor GPU performance, you can use the following tools:

* NVIDIA System Management Interface Tool (SMI): This tool provides detailed information about GPU temperatures, memory usage, and clock speeds.
* GPU-Z: A free utility that displays detailed information about your GPU, including its model, memory, and driver version.
* Nsight Systems: A visual debugger for NVIDIA GPUs that provides real-time monitoring of system performance.

These tools can be used to monitor GPU performance in real-time, allowing you to identify bottlenecks and optimize your system's performance.
