[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m>  of texts or answers. The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts,  ranging from identical (low variance) to highly divergent (high variance).  The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  for the score. Here is a more detailed explanation of the various std scores:
 0: The texts are virtually identical.
 1: The texts are virtually identical in topic and context, but differ in wording.
 2: The texts handle the same topic, but show minor variations in context and signifficant variations in wording.
 3: The texts handle the same topic, but show signifficant variations in both, context and wording.
 4. The texts show signifficant variations in context and wording. Also at least one text is completely off topic.
 5. The texts are partially related however, there is multiple texts that talk about different topics.
 6. The texts are completely unrelated.


[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
 ```JSON
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ signifficantly in wording and emphasis on the dog condition.'
  }
```
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, 
  leading to a relatively small variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Objective is to derrive a semantic standard deviation between 0 and 6 of the  provided RESPONSE SAMPLE`s using the outlined stratey. The reader intends to understand  the degree of variation or similarity between the provided responses.

[34m# Monitoring GPU Performance[39m
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools depending on the operating system and type of GPU. Here are some common methods:

### Windows

1. **Resource Monitor**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager, then click on the ""Performance"" tab.
2. **GPU-Z**: A free tool that displays detailed information about your graphics card, including temperature, memory usage, and performance metrics.
3. **Nvidia GPU Monitoring Tools** (for NVIDIA GPUs): The GeForce Experience software provides real-time monitoring of GPU usage, temperature, and fan speed.

### Linux

1. **top** or **htop**: These command-line tools display system resource usage, including CPU, memory, and GPU utilization.
2. **glxgears**: A benchmarking tool that also displays GPU performance metrics.
3. **GPU-Z** (also available for Linux): Similar to the Windows version, it provides detailed information about your graphics card.

### macOS

1. **Activity Monitor**: Open the Activity Monitor app to view system resource usage, including CPU, memory, and GPU utilization.
2. **GPU-Z** (for NVIDIA GPUs) or **AMD Radeon Software** (for AMD GPUs): Similar to the Windows version, these tools provide real-time monitoring of GPU usage and performance.

### Additional Tools

* **HWiNFO**: A comprehensive system information tool that displays detailed hardware data, including GPU information.
* **GPU Monitor**: A lightweight tool that provides real-time monitoring of GPU temperature, fan speed, and performance metrics.

[34m# Monitoring GPU Performance[39m
To monitor your GPU performance, you can use various tools depending on your operating system and the specific GPU model. Here are a few common methods:

### On Linux Systems:
1. **nvidia-smi**: This command-line tool is provided by NVIDIA for their GPUs. It displays detailed information about the current state of all GPUs in the system, including temperature, memory usage, and performance metrics.

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

2. **top** or **htop**: These utilities can help you monitor CPU and memory usage, but they also provide information about GPU utilization.

```bash
top -busy | grep 'GPU'
```

or

```bash
htop -C -p $(pgrep NVIDIA)
```

3. **glxgears** or **driver benchmarking tools**: These programs can stress test your GPU and give you an idea of its performance under load.

```bash
glxgears
```

### On Windows:
1. **NVIDIA GeForce Experience**: This software provides detailed monitoring of GPU usage, temperature, and performance in the GPU settings within the Control Panel.

2. **Resource Monitor**: Also known as Performance Information and Metrics for Windows (PerfMon), this utility can show you how much resources your GPU is using, which includes memory and processing power.

   - Go to Start > Performance Information & Metrics
   - In the Performance Information window, click on CPU or under the CPU section, select the Processes tab.
   - Right-click in that list and choose 'Filter' and then select the Processes for which you want to see GPU usage. You can use this to find out if a particular process is using your GPU.

3. **GPU-Z**: A free tool that provides detailed information about your graphics card, including model number, memory capacity, and clock speed.

   - Download GPU-Z from [here](https://www.green-temp.net/gpu-z/).
   - Run the executable to see a list of your system's components.

### On macOS:
1. **nvidia-smi**: Similar to Linux, you can use this command-line tool for detailed information about your NVIDIA GPUs.

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

2. **Activity Monitor**: This utility is included with macOS and provides real-time monitoring of CPU usage, memory usage, and other system resources. While not specifically designed for GPU monitoring, it can show you how much resource each process is
