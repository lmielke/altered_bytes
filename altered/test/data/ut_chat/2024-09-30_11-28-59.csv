"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Built-in monitoring software from your GPU manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software) is a common approach to track GPU usage, temperature, and memory usage in real-time.

Third-party software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 can also be used to monitor performance. For Linux systems, `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `amd-gpu-profiler` (for AMD GPUs) are built-in monitoring tools.

Some games and graphics-intensive applications provide built-in monitoring features that allow you to track your GPU's performance during gameplay. Additionally, adjusting fan settings and power limits through the BIOS or UEFI settings can be done using manufacturer-specific software or third-party utilities like Afterburner.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. First, check the manufacturer's software for monitoring and control options. Many GPUs have built-in utilities that provide real-time performance data.

Additionally, you can use third-party software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner to monitor temperatures, clock speeds, and memory usage. Some systems also allow you to adjust fan settings and power limits through the BIOS or UEFI settings.

If you're using a Linux system, you can use tools like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `amdgpu-pro-monitor` (for AMD GPUs) to monitor performance and adjust settings.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. One common approach is to use the built-in monitoring software provided by your GPU manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software). These tools allow you to track GPU usage, temperature, and memory usage in real-time.

You can also use third-party software like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64 to monitor your GPU's performance. Additionally, many Linux distributions provide built-in monitoring tools like `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs and `amd-gpu-profiler` for AMD GPUs.
