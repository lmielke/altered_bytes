"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we need to identify common themes and unique details from each response.

**Common Themes:**

1. GPU monitoring tools: NVIDIA Nsight Systems, GPU-Z, MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision X
2. Command-line tools: `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs

**Unique Details:**

1. Response 1: Emphasizes the importance of using a comprehensive toolset like NVIDIA Nsight Systems.
2. Response 2: Highlights the use of GPU-Z as a lightweight utility for displaying detailed information about graphics cards.
3. Response 3: Mentions EVGA Precision X as another popular monitoring software.

**Weighted Summary:**

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems or GPU-Z. These tools provide real-time monitoring and profiling capabilities. Additionally, you can also use command-line utilities like `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs or `glrxinfo` for AMD GPUs.

For a more comprehensive approach, consider using a toolset that includes:

* NVIDIA Nsight Systems: A comprehensive toolset for monitoring, profiling, and optimizing NVIDIA GPUs.
* GPU-Z: A lightweight utility that displays detailed information about your graphics card, including temperature, memory usage, and more.
* MSI Afterburner: A popular overclocking and monitoring software for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.

These tools can help you track performance metrics such as frame rates, temperatures, and memory usage, allowing you to identify bottlenecks and optimize your system for better performance.","[33mStrategy Prompt[0m using agg_mean:


[34m# 3. Instructions (INST)[39m

[34m## Weighted Mean Aggregation[39m
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
