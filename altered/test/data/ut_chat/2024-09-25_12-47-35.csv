"# Monitoring GPU Performance
You can monitor your GPU's performance using various tools and methods.

## Built-in Tools and Third-Party Software
Most GPUs have built-in monitoring tools, such as NVIDIA Control Panel (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD Radeon Settings (for AMD GPUs). These tools provide real-time performance metrics, including temperature, memory usage, and clock speeds. You can also use third-party software, like GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner, to monitor your GPU's performance.

## Monitoring Methods
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools like NVIDIA Control Panel (for Windows) or System Information (for macOS). On Linux, you can use `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs and `lshw` or `inxi` for a general overview. You can also use third-party software such as GPU-Z or Afterburner to monitor and control your GPU's performance.

## Additional Methods
You can also check GPU usage using the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) on Windows, and look for GPU temperature and fan speed information in Device Manager. Additionally, you can install MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X1 to adjust GPU settings and monitor performance in real-time.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Read the provided prompts or  re-construct the prompt or problem statement based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
