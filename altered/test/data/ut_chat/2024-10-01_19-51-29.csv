# Monitor GPU Performance
## Overview of GPU Monitoring Tools
Various tools are available for monitoring GPU performance, including NVIDIA's NVML and AMD's ADL.

## Recommended Tools for Performance Monitoring
1. **GPU-Z**: A lightweight tool that provides detailed information about your system's GPUs, including temperature, voltage, memory usage, and more.
2. **NVML (NVIDIA Management Library)**: Allows you to monitor GPU performance, including temperatures, memory usage, and power consumption.
3. **AMD Radeon Software**: Provides tools for monitoring GPU performance, including a real-time monitoring section.

## Tips for Efficient Monitoring
- Regularly check GPU temperatures and voltages to ensure optimal performance and prevent overheating.
- Monitor system resource utilization to identify bottlenecks in your workflow.
- Use these tools to optimize your GPU settings for better performance.

Additionally, you can use the following commands to monitor GPU performance:
- `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs)
- `mpciola` (for AMD GPUs)

You can also use system monitoring tools like `top`, `htop`, or `sysdig` to track resource utilization and identify potential bottlenecks in your system.

Note: This list is not exhaustive, and you may need to use additional tools or commands depending on your specific setup.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

# Answer
## Monitoring GPU Performance
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use tools like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `mpciola` (for AMD GPUs). These commands display detailed information about your GPU's temperature, memory usage, and clock speeds. You can also use third-party software like GPU-Z or HWiNFO to monitor performance.

Alternatively, you can use system monitoring tools like `top`, `htop`, or `sysdig` to track resource utilization and identify potential bottlenecks in your system.

## Common Commands
- `nvidia-smi`
- `mpciola -d 0x10`
- `GPU-Z`
- `HWiNFO`

Note: This list is not exhaustive, and you may need to use additional tools or commands depending on your specific setup.
