[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.

To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use the following tools and methods:

1. **NVIDIA Driver**: Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA driver installed on your system. You can check for updates in the Device Manager or through the NVIDIA website.
2. **GPU-Z**: A free tool that provides detailed information about your GPU, including temperature, memory usage, and clock speeds.
3. **HWMonitor**: Another free tool that offers real-time monitoring of GPU temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds.
4. **MSI Afterburner**: A popular software for overclocking and monitoring GPUs. It also provides detailed performance metrics and alerts you to any issues.
5. **System Monitoring Software**: Most operating systems come with built-in system monitoring tools that can provide information about your GPU's performance.

Additionally, you can use command-line tools like:

1. `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs)
2. `glxgears` or `3DMark` (for benchmarking and stress testing)

Regularly checking these metrics will help you identify any issues with your GPU's performance and allow you to take corrective action.
