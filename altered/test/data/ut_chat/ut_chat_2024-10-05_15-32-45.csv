[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.

[34m# Answer[39m
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use the following tools and methods:

1. **NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)**: A set of libraries that provide access to NVIDIA GPU management features. You can install NVML on your system and use its command-line interface to monitor GPU temperatures, memory usage, and other performance metrics.
2. **GPU-Z**: A free tool that provides detailed information about your NVIDIA or AMD GPU, including temperature, voltage, memory, and fan speed.
3. **HwMonitor**: A lightweight monitoring tool that displays real-time data on CPU, GPU, and RAM temperatures, voltages, and frequencies.
4. **System Monitor**: Most operating systems have a built-in system monitor that provides information about CPU, GPU, and RAM usage.

To monitor your GPU's performance in the command line:

* On Linux: `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `amdgpuinfo` (for AMD GPUs)
* On Windows: Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and type `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs)

To monitor your GPU's performance using a GUI tool:

* GPU-Z
* HwMonitor
* System Monitor

Remember to always follow proper shutdown procedures when stopping or restarting your system to avoid data loss or corruption.
