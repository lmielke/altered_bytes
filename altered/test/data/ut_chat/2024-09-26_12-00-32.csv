"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use built-in tools like NVIDIA Control Panel (for Windows) or AMD Radeon Settings (for Windows and macOS). On Linux, you can use tools like `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA GPUs or `amd-gpu-profiler` for AMD GPUs. Additionally, third-party software such as GPU-Z provides detailed information about your GPU's specifications and performance.

Monitoring software like HWiNFO or AIDA64 can provide a comprehensive overview of your system's hardware and performance. You can also use built-in tools to monitor performance in real-time, helping you identify any potential issues. Stress tests or benchmarking tools like Unigine Heaven or 3DMark can be used to evaluate your GPU's performance.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use tools like:

* NVIDIA Control Panel (for Windows) or System Information (for macOS)
* AMD Radeon Settings (for Windows) or System Report (for macOS)
* Monitoring software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64
* Using the Linux command `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `amd-gpu-profiler` (for AMD GPUs)

You can also check your system's event logs for any errors related to the GPU. Additionally, you can run stress tests or benchmarking tools like Unigine Heaven or 3DMark to evaluate your GPU's performance.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, follow these steps:

*   Install a monitoring software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or Afterburner.
*   Launch the software and navigate to the GPU tab.
*   Look for metrics like clock speed, memory usage, temperature, and power consumption.
*   You can also use built-in tools like NVIDIA Control Panel (for NVIDIA GPUs) or AMD Radeon Settings (for AMD GPUs) to monitor performance.

These tools will provide you with real-time data on your GPU's performance, helping you identify any potential issues.
