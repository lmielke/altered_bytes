"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and software. Commonly recommended options include NVIDIA GeForce Experience (for NVIDIA GPUs) and AMD Radeon Software (for AMD GPUs). Additionally, third-party monitoring software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, and MSI Afterburner provide detailed information about your GPU's temperature, usage, memory usage, and performance metrics like frames per second (FPS) and rendering time.

For Windows users, the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) can be used to navigate to the Performance tab, where a ""GPU"" section displays usage, memory, and other metrics. On Linux, commands like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `radeontop` (for AMD GPUs) in the terminal can also monitor performance.

Many modern motherboards and laptops have built-in monitoring tools that display GPU usage and temperatures. These tools help track your GPU's temperature, usage, and performance in real-time, providing valuable insights into its operation.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and software. For NVIDIA GPUs, you can use the NVIDIA Control Panel or the NVIDIA System Monitor. For AMD GPUs, you can use the AMD Radeon Software or the AMD Overdrive tool. Additionally, you can also use third-party monitoring software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or MSI Afterburner. These tools provide detailed information about your GPU's temperature, usage, memory usage, and performance metrics like frames per second (FPS) and rendering time.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. For Windows, you can use the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and navigate to the Performance tab, where you'll find a ""GPU"" section that displays usage, memory, and other metrics. Alternatively, you can use third-party software like GPU-Z, HWMonitor, or MSI Afterburner. On Linux, you can use the `nvidia-smi` command (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `radeontop` (for AMD GPUs) in the terminal to monitor performance. Additionally, many modern motherboards and laptops have built-in monitoring tools that display GPU usage and temperatures.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 3__
# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and software. Some popular options include:

* NVIDIA GeForce Experience (for NVIDIA GPUs)
* AMD Radeon Software (for AMD GPUs)
* GPU-Z: A lightweight tool that provides detailed information about your GPU.
* HWiNFO: A comprehensive system monitoring tool that includes GPU monitoring.

These tools can help you track your GPU's temperature, usage, and performance in real-time. Additionally, many graphics cards come with built-in monitoring software that can be accessed through the device settings or control panel.
