[34m## Description: Std Aggregation[39m
This strategy calculates the standard deviation of similarity between a given <[46msample[0m> of texts or answers.  The goal is to measure the degree of variance between the texts, ranging from identical (low variance)  to highly divergent (high variance). The output is a JSON string that provides a standard deviation score  from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification for the score.

[34m## Example[39m
Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - ""Response 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - ""Response 2: A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - ""Response 3: The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  {
    'std': 2, 
    'reasoning': 'The texts are similar in describing the same action but differ slightly in wording and emphasis on the dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s condition.'
  }
  
  In this case, the responses share a common theme but vary in their descriptions, leading to a moderate variance score of 2.

[34m## Objective[39m
Read and understand the following <[46msample[0m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, calculate the standard deviation of similarity between the texts, providing a  score from 0 (virtually identical) to 6 (no commonalities), along with a short justification  explaining the reasoning behind the chosen score. The output should be a JSON string in the  format {'std': <int>, 'reasoning': '<justification>'}.

[34m# Monitoring GPU Performance[39m

[34m## Overview of NVIDIA Drivers and System Requirements[39m
To monitor GPU performance, you'll need to install the NVIDIA drivers on your system. Ensure your graphics card is compatible with your operating system.

[34m## Using NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)[39m
NVML provides a simple API for monitoring GPU performance. You can use the `nvidia-smi` command in the terminal to view detailed information about your GPUs, including temperature, memory usage, and clock speeds.

[34m## Monitoring GPU Performance using Python[39m
You can use libraries like PyCUDA or PyOpenCL to monitor GPU performance programmatically. These libraries provide interfaces for accessing NVIDIA devices and monitoring their performance.

[34m## System Configuration and Optimization[39m
Optimizing system configuration, such as adjusting power settings or disabling unnecessary services, can help improve GPU performance. Additionally, ensuring your drivers are up-to-date and that your graphics card is properly seated in the PCIe slot can also impact performance.

[34m## Additional Tools for Monitoring GPU Performance[39m
Other tools like GPU-Z, GeForce Experience, or HWiNFO provide detailed information about your GPUs, including model numbers, memory sizes, and temperatures.
