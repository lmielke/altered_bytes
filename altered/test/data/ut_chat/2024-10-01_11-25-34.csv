"To create a weighted summary of the provided responses, we will analyze the key points mentioned in each response and assign weights based on their frequency and relevance.

**Weighted Summary**

Monitoring GPU performance is crucial for optimal system performance. The most common methods to monitor GPU performance are:

*   **Using NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)**: NVML provides an interface to query and control NVIDIA GPUs. It can be installed using pip (`pip install nvidia-mmlibv2`) or conda (`conda install -c nvml nvidia-mmlibv2`).
*   **Using CUDA Profiler**: CUDA Profiler is a tool that provides detailed information about GPU memory usage, data transfer rates, and other performance metrics. It can be run using the `nvprof` command-line tool.
*   **System Monitoring Tools**: System monitoring tools such as `top`, `htop`, or `systemd-analyze` provide real-time information about CPU and memory usage, which can help identify potential bottlenecks in applications.
*   **GPU Monitoring Software**: Dedicated GPU monitoring software like GPU-Z, NVMonitor, or GPU-M provide detailed information about GPU temperature, memory usage, and other performance metrics.

To monitor GPU performance, it is recommended to:

*   Regularly check performance metrics using tools like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `glrxinfo` (for AMD GPUs).
*   Keep your GPU drivers up-to-date, as newer drivers often include performance improvements.
*   Use command-line tools and system monitoring software to monitor performance metrics.

By following these methods and best practices, you can effectively monitor your GPU's performance and optimize your system for better performance.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[36msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[36msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 1__
# The answer field contains the model response
## Answer
Monitor your GPU performance using tools like NVIDIA System Management Interface (SMI) or AMD Radeon Pro Software. These tools provide detailed information on temperature, memory usage, and clock speeds.

To access SMI, open a command prompt as an administrator and type `nvidia-smi`. This will display information about your GPUs, including their status and performance metrics.

Alternatively, you can use the GPU-Z software to monitor your GPU's temperature, voltage, and fan speed.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 2__
# The answer field contains the model response
## Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use the following methods:

### Method 1: Using NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)
 NVML is a software library that provides an interface to query and control NVIDIA GPUs. You can install NVML on your system using pip (`pip install nvidia-mmlibv2`) or conda (`conda install -c nvml nvidia-mmlibv2`).

### Method 2: Using CUDA Profiler
 CUDA Profiler is a tool that provides detailed information about GPU memory usage, data transfer rates, and other performance metrics. You can run the profiler using the `nvprof` command-line tool.

### Method 3: Using System Monitoring Tools
You can also use system monitoring tools such as `top`, `htop`, or `systemd-analyze` to monitor your GPU's performance. These tools provide real-time information about CPU and memory usage, which can help you identify potential bottlenecks in your application.

### Method 4: Using GPU Monitoring Software
There are also dedicated GPU monitoring software such as GPU-Z, NVMonitor, or GPU-M, that provide detailed information about GPU temperature, memory usage, and other performance metrics.

__RESPONSE SAMPLE 3__
# Answer
Monitoring GPU performance involves tracking various metrics such as temperature, power consumption, and memory usage. To monitor your GPUs' performance, you can use tools like NVIDIA's Nsight or AMD's Radeon Software. These tools provide real-time monitoring and allow you to adjust settings for optimal performance.

Additionally, you can use command-line tools like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `glrxinfo` (for AMD GPUs) to monitor performance metrics. By regularly checking these metrics, you can identify any issues with your GPU's performance and take corrective action.

It is also recommended to keep your GPU drivers up-to-date, as newer drivers often include performance improvements.
