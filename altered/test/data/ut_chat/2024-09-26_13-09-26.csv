"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. Here are some options:

*   **Built-in monitoring tools:** Most GPUs have built-in monitoring tools that allow you to track performance metrics such as temperature, clock speed, memory usage, and power consumption.
*   **Third-party software:** There are several third-party software options available that provide detailed GPU monitoring capabilities, including GPU-Z, HWiNFO, and Afterburner.
*   **System monitoring tools:** You can also use system monitoring tools like System Monitor (Windows) or Activity Monitor (macOS) to track overall system performance, which includes GPU usage.

Additionally, you can check the NVIDIA Control Panel (for GeForce GPUs) or AMD Radeon Settings (for Radeon GPUs), which often include performance monitoring and optimization features. Many games and applications also offer built-in performance monitoring tools.

It's worth noting that using system monitoring software like Task Manager or System Monitor can help keep an eye on your GPU's usage and temperature. You can also check your system's event logs for any errors or warnings related to your GPU.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
