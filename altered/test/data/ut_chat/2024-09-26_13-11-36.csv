"# Answer
To monitor your GPU's performance, you can use various tools and methods. One common approach is to install software such as GPU-Z, HWiNFO, or AIDA64, which provide detailed information about your GPU's specifications, temperature, clock speeds, and usage. Built-in Windows utilities like Task Manager or Performance Monitor can also be used to monitor GPU performance in real-time. Many graphics drivers offer their own monitoring tools, such as NVIDIA's GeForce Experience or AMD's Radeon Software. Additionally, you can use third-party applications like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) or `amd-gpu-profiler` (for AMD GPUs) on Linux-based systems to monitor and manage your GPU's performance. It is recommended to check system event logs for any errors or warnings related to your GPU.","[33mStrategy Prompt[39m using agg_mean:


# 3. Instructions (INST)

## Weighted Mean Aggregation
This strategy generates a weighted average summary from a given <[35msample[39m> of texts or answers.  Instead of taking a strict average, the focus is on synthesizing key points from all responses,  with emphasis placed on the most relevant or repeated ideas. The result is a balanced summary  that gives proportional weight to both common themes and unique insights, while still ensuring  that frequently mentioned or significant ideas receive more attention.

Example: Assume the following prompt or statement, ""What happens when foxes meet dogs?"".  We received the following responses.
  - Response 1: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""
  - Response 2: ""A fox swiftly leaps over a sleeping dog with grace and speed.""
  - Response 3: ""The nimble fox hops over a lethargic dog.""
Expected Output:
  ""Foxes typically leap over dogs, whether described as lazy, sleeping, or lethargic.
  The common portrayal is that of a nimble, graceful fox in motion, although Text 2 emphasizes 
  the speed of the fox more than the other descriptions.""
  
  This output gives more weight to common themes, like the fox leaping, while incorporating 
  details from all the responses, balancing frequent mentions with unique contributions.

## Objective
Read and understand the following <[35msample[39m> texts! Then, read and understand the provided  prompts or, (if no prompt was provided), re-construct the prompt or problem statement  based on the provided responses. Then, create a weighted average summary that synthesizes key points from all the responses,  giving more emphasis to frequently mentioned themes, while still incorporating unique contributions  where they add value. The summary should reflect the overall balance of common and unique points.
