    ""answer"": ""If you have CUDA installed, you can use the nvidia-smi command-
line tool to monitor your NVIDIA GPU performance. This tool provides detailed
information about your GPU, including memory usage, temperature, and more. You
can access this information in PowerShell by using the following command:
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used,memory.total,temperature.gpu --format=csv.
This will provide you with a comma-separated list of values that you can easily
