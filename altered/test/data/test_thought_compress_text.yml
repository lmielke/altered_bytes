  # Why is the Sky Blue?
  
  The blue color of the sky is a phenomenon rooted in the interactions between sunlight and 
  Earthâ€™s atmosphere. This explanation combines physics and atmospheric science to understand 
  how light behaves in different conditions.
  
  ## The Nature of Sunlight
  
  Sunlight, while appearing white to the naked eye, is actually made up of a spectrum of colors 
  that include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. 
  Each color represents light waves of different wavelengths, with red having 
  the longest wavelength and violet the shortest.
  
  ### The Spectrum of Light and Wavelengths
  
  The visible light spectrum spans wavelengths from approximately 380 nanometers (violet) to 
  700 nanometers (red). Shorter wavelengths correspond to colors like blue 
  and violet, while longer wavelengths correlate with colors like red and orange.
  
  ## Interaction of Light with Atmospheric Particles
  
  When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters various particles like nitrogen and 
  oxygen molecules. These particles scatter the sunlight in different directions, 
  with the scattering effect being more pronounced for shorter wavelengths.
  
  ### Rayleigh Scattering: The Key to Blue Skies
  
  The phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering explains why we see a predominantly blue sky. 
  Rayleigh scattering occurs when light interacts with particles much smaller than its 
  wavelength, scattering shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) more efficiently than longer 
  wavelengths (red and orange).
  
  #### Rayleigh Scattering Formula
  
  The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the 
  wavelength, which can be represented as follows:
  
  ```python
  
  scattering_intensity = (1 / wavelength**4) * particle_density
    
  ```
