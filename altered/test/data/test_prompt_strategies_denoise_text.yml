  I have tried Get-Process and Get-CimInstance Win32_Process to get GPU usage and GPU memory, but both of them can't offer those information.
  In Windows Task Manager, it can show GPU memory.
  So, is there a way to get those in powershell
  Windows uses Performance Counters to track this type of thing. You can get the values in powershell via Get-Counter. Depending on your GPU
  and drivers, you may have more specific counters available, but these examples should always be available:
  I found these counter names by running Get-Counter -ListSet 'GPU*', and taking the Counter values from there. It looks like GPU engine usage
  is broken down into 4 types:
  I'm just summing engtype_3D in the example, since it is the only one with usage on my system. These values all match up with what displays
  in windows Task Manager, so it should be accurate enough.

  I try to pickup GPU usage of my c# app but there is no way i can doit and make that wrk with NVDIA, AMD, or Intel.
  Trough powershell is possible to obtain that info, example:
  This show the gpu usage and work like a charm on any graphic card.
  How can pickup in asyncronous way the result?
  Of curse async in order not create blocking thread.
  Here the full code to pickup the GPU usage from your app or any process, put inside a timer fire this every one second. Work with Intel,
  Nvidia, AMD.
  The script gpu.ps:
  Script for global gpu , cpu etc, take a lok on:
