    Estimate the semantic deviation between the provided responses (std).
    STD here is an integer value (from 0 to 3) for the semantic deviation.
    - 0: No deviation, responses are extremely similar or even identical.
    - 1: Low deviation, responses are similar but differ in some details. 
      For example, one answer might go deeper or explain additional aspects.
    - 2: Moderate deviation, responses differ in several aspects. 
      Some outliers might even differ in their overall topic.
    - 3: High deviation, responses are very different, mostly describing
      different unrelated topics.

    # Question: What is AI?

    # Provided answers
    1. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.
    2. AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
    3. AI involves machine learning and deep learning.

    # Prompt
    Estimate the semantic deviation between the answers.

    # Answer
    {'responses_std': '2', 'reasoning': 'Responses differ in their emphasis on AI aspects.'}

    Respond with a json string containing the std value and your reasoning! 
    Example: {'responses_std': '1', 'reasoning': 'The responses ...'}
